The phone after 1 month started with different problems, the battery durability is just one day and I need charge every day, the screen sometimes its freezes and the unique solution is return the phone, but I asking about the guarantee, where is the guarantee? Because in my case I need a phone, just I want the replacement because the phone started with different problems. Sincerely I am so disappointed with Amazon and this service, if you can’t give to Apple customers great service, please don’t seller products from Apple. I will go to an official Apple Store and send the phone to they see everything for me. Because Amazon only accept the return to give a refund. They don’t have Iphones to replacement and the client in this case is a complete idiot.Update: Firstly, after many times contacting Amazon I tried to return the product, but they classified it as non-returnable. Why? I don’t know because the window return was to 31 January and I tried return before its day.Secondly, I went to the Apple Store and a technician saw everything on the phone. The phone camera has an internal issue, and the phone has problem with battery, and screen frezes too. Sometimes half screen is in black, sometimes freezes. Now I have a phone that doesn't work correctly and Amazon customer service doesn't want to accept the return or a replacement. Honestly this is so crazy because I bought it with many illusion and now that’s the great support that Amazon gives for me. Of course I will look about my rights because I will not be with a factory defected phone.Thirdly, I have an email from Apple Store, where they say exactly issues the phone has. I want a simple replacement or return this product. I don’t understand why is it so complicating and frustrating for me.

First impressions of the iPhone 15 - by comparison, a bland, uninteresting design in an uninspiring choice of colours. I'm getting used to the face recognition, which seems very efficient, even in low light, but I find less universally adopted by some of the apps I use, compared to touch ID. Battery life is excellent - with my conservative use, I find I can go three or four days between charges.  I was impressed by how easy it was to transfer the settings etc. from my old 'phone to the new one - I was up and running in very little time. Probably the most significant improvements over its immediate predecessor are in the area of capturing pictures - something I tend to do with a camera, being a bit old-school (I really should try to get with the programme!). There's no socket for a headphone jack, so I've been obliged to purchase a modestly priced pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I find they work very well with streamed music. Image quality is good - as you'd expect - and the phone has the capacity to do a great deal more than I will ever ask of it. For someone who will make extensive use of its features, the iPhone 15 probably represents great value for money; for me, probably less so.

This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Not using power mode yet, and usually not n medium-to-low brightness as well & it still gets through using apps like snap,insta, drive, maps & others. Even playing games like Diablo immortal & Simpsons tapped out.Camera is an absolute must, although in-doors it seems to lack to older models. It really relies on more light even in basic settings.Sound, screen, pixels, everything is gorgeous. The size is noticeable if you come from any pro or max, but for the price, reliability, and quality it isn’t that bad.

I needed to spread the cost but also have the full facility of a phone without having to negotiate credit cards, which I didn't want to get into, or pay massive upfront costs. For sixty quid a month (plus my tiny GiffGaff sim) I have a new phone, which will be all paid in a year. I also got 2T of iCould storage and an external generic hard drive for my old Mac around the same time for about 25 quid. This meant I could 'start again' with my Mac, and the endless photos from my travels could be stored safely while I save up for a new Macbook. Meanwhile, this phone has double the storage of my old Macbook. Unlike my old phone, it can perform admin tasks when I'm in quiet moments at work, such as applying for jobs. I'm not meaning to explain phones, it's just that for me new tech isn't renewed that often and I had to justify the expense to myself. This phone has already proved itself over the last month. The camera is much better than my old phone, but not quite as flashy as the most recent iPhone. I couldn't justify an extra 300 quid for a camera, regardless of my professional art needs, that wouldn't really meet my landscape photography needs. You still can't fit a mirror inside an iPhone in order to make it perform as well as an SLR. it's jus tnot physically possible yet to lose that terrible over-size foreground emphasis you get inmost smartphone pics. But for reference photos, portrait photography with friends, and general snaps this camera is good. I have an SLR I will use for landscapes instead, and may upgrade. The joy of a new phone is being able to listen to all the music you couldn't store on the old one, being able to perform complex functions a less powerful phone can't deal with, and also being able to indulge all your interests/needs in one place without worrying about space. I prioritised my phone upgrade before my Macbook upgrade for precisely this reason. If you have to choose between which one to upgrade, I'd go with the phone as you can always get cables to link your phone to a projector or tv screen if you're a student or trying to cut costs in the current economy. I'm amazed at how much I can watch on my unlimited data plan - the only risk is becoming a bit of an internet-addict too quickly. I love a new app called Metronaut too, so useful for musicians, and it's a relief to be able to indule my passions wihtout fear of freeze or collapse. Whenever I have had problems with this, it just requires a switch-off/switch-on - it's usually as I've had too much activity on my phone (for like, hours) or I just haven't closed pages. I""m impressed with the low-light picture-taking too - I can instantly update photos to Insta even in difficult light conditions. It means a better-documented moment-to-moment sense of of the World, and memories get stored, isntead of lost in storage collapse and frustration.

The reason I purchased this.Nicely boxed with tamper sealingComplete with a Braided usb-c lead accessory which is cool.Has the usual sim pin included in the UK.I wish the telecoms market would get their act together on eSIM.Colour, I had intended to get boring black but I chose a pastel Matt Green with the glossy apple logo to the rear. Chosen more due to the fact that the other colours had sold out but I actually like it now I’ve got it and its colour is concealed in my OtterBox Strada case anyway.On opening, the first thing you will notice is how lightweight the phone is and in my position only weighed down by the case weight.You will notice the dual cameras are very pronounced and the phone doesn’t lay flat on a surface.My case offers excellent protection for the lenses and allows it to lay flush.The iPhone has an aluminium casing with lovely rounded edges.Set up for my experience. This was the painful part.Transferring data from my iPhone 11 was not the easiest of tasks and I had to take an update to the fifteen before it would initiate the transfer process.However Once completed my new phone was near identical in appearance and usability apart from one or two apps that required setting up again.The Home Screen is large, bright and colourful is blessed with something called the Dynamic island which alters its size and shape dependent on the app that requires it.This is a great feature introduced to recent Apple phones and transforms the viewing experience when watching content playback of the likes  of Prime, Netflix, Disney etc.It is finally a really enjoyable viewing experience now the dreaded notch has gone.Some have mentioned a lower refresh rate on this model compared to the Pro models but is not a noticeable problem for me.Not just watching but the Sound quality even at low volumes is brilliant particularly when watching movies.Watch Blade Runner 2049 or rather listen to it on the Apple app is a totally immersive experience even without AirPods.Officer K’s visit to the Wallace Corporation’s Earth Headquarters has great depth and echo as he exchanges dialogue with the file clerk and Luv in its large halls.iOS 17 standby mode is slightly disappointing down to the exclusivity of the pro models only having an always on display. But this is the only real disappointment of this model.The ability to plug in USB devices and exchange data or charge or receive power from other devices is a real step forward.Battery life is phenomenal. End of!Doesn’t get hot when charging and lasts ages. Unless you have got it glued to your face you can expect a couple of days between charges for average use and when the battery is new of course.I have some older wireless chargers that are struggling a bit to charge through the mag safe case with the phone attached.This hasn’t been an issue before with my other phones. I haven’t got a new type mag safe charger yet and is not really a phone issueThe camera has several new features including automatically picking out portraits without specifically switching to portrait mode.It has a up to 48 mega pixel camera and with iOS 17 can produce bokeh effect portraits.There are some brilliant video modes including a live action sports type mode.4K or HD recording and frame rate adjustment.

I was not impressed with the cable that came with it, when I removed it from my plug the cover of the usb came off in my hands, so threw that straight in the bin and I ordered a set of 2 x fast charging plugs with the cables.

I am definitely lagging behind with smartphones. After much nagging from everybody I decided to purchase my first iPhone but they were ridiculously expensive so I decided to try a refurbished one. The first one that I had was the iPhone SE but there was a problem with that so it had to go back. I also realised that the phone was actually too small and I didn’t really think that I was getting all the benefits that I would with an iPhone. Therefore I paid a bit more and got this one and I am so glad I did.The phone was in excellent condition with no marks or scratches. It came boxed p, but not in the original iPhone box and it had a charger which was not a genuine Apple one but there’s not been any problems using it. I have had an iPad for a number of years, so I found the interface easy to work with. I love the fact that my photos, emails etc are shared between the two as it makes life so much easier.I think that iPhones, whether they are refurbished or new, are ridiculously overpriced so I am gong have to take a star off for that, but, apart from that, I have been very impressed by this iPhone and if money is an issue I think buying refurbished is definitely the way to go. My bad experience did not put me off and I am very glad it did not, as this one is really good,

Customer Service is very Poor!,"I’ve had this phone now for 10 months. It came very new looking but the battery life was sub-optimal and considerably below what was advertised as the guaranteed minimum. I contacted the seller and despite there apparently being a Amazon guarantee on the item, the seller told me that as I was outside of the 30 day usual limit (only just btw), I was not eligible for a refund. The most they could do was get me to send back the phone and they would ‘take a look at it’. This would leave me without any phone for probably somewhere in the region of 10-14 days, possibly longer because of the postal strikes. They refused to send me out a temporary phone so that I had something to use and to put my phone stuff onto it.Since then, (that was end of last year), the phone has got steadily worse. It runs very hot, so much so that I cannot use it at the same time as charging it for fear it might explode.  Also, I am scared to charge it for long periods because of the heat, and so charge it in bursts to keep the heat levels safe. I can’t use the torch function for any length of time because it gets really hot and  starts freezing.  In fact it regularly freezes, runs very very slow and has weird glitches eg when I’m composing a message or a post, it suddenly starts deleting it and can’t be stopped. The freezing thing is a daily event.Recently it has started doing something really funky and seriously worrying; it goes into ‘unavailable’ mode. This is a random thing and not in any way related to putting in the wrong passcode. I’m actually at the point that I am terrified that at some point it will permanently lock me out! Today it locked me out for 1 hour - this was not as a result of any wrongly inputted passcode, just purely random. When I read up about this, should I get locked out permanently, the only way to remedy it is to wipe the phone and lose all data - so be really aware of this issue and back up regularly!This is all awful and not at all what should be expected from a phone that was touted as ‘renewed’. I was especially annoyed by all this because Amazon’s guarantee seems somewhat flimsy if you actually need to use it.Bad customer service!!!!!

I found the XR's virtual buttons really irritating and eventually went back to my previous iPhone 7. I liked having the physical control of a home button. There was nothing much wrong with my iPhone 7, but it was getting a bit old, so I decided to replace it.My 17 year old son jokes that 'SE' stands for 'Senile & Elderly' - and there may be something in that. The cell phone was exactly the same form as my iPhone 7 (I thought the case and screen protector would probably have fitted), but is more modern internals. It doesn't have facial recognition (good) but does have fingerprint control on the home button. There is nothing not to like on this cell phone for an old fogey like me.After a hiccup with the first parcel (Amazon lost it in transit) a replacement turned up on time. The iPhone SE largely set itself up from my iPhone 7's iCloud backup file and was ready to use in about half an hour. It is just like the iPhone 7 in every way, except it is a bit faster, has a better camera and battery life.

Its replaced a very old non digital phone so its taking him awhile getting used to it. My personal crib is why do we not get a manual with these expensive smart phones, we are not born with the skills to operate them, I have had mine 2 years and can just about make calls but I am still struggling with texts..At  the end of the day the I Phones are well made and of great quality if we could only use them !!

I am not a fan of social media and I am old fashioned enough to actually like using a camera for taking photo’s ( yep iam a bit of a dinosaur), so I don’t need 3 cameras on my phone or a large screen to watch memes or videos on. The last model I had was the 2020 SE which has lasted well, it still has a 88% battery capacity after fairly heavy use and the battery still lasts a whole day without needing a top up  ( bought on day of release). TBH I would still be using it but I wanted a phone capable of a 5G connection as I get 5G for not extra cost on my sim. The SE range has a decent chip running things behind the scenes and I use mostly cloud storage so the 64GB Ram is more the enough for my needs. The phone is compact, I don’t know why people want to carry around these huge 6.7 inch phones that stick out of their pockets 🤣.  At 4.7 inch this is big enough for me. So if you want a decent phone and your not into SM, watching movies etc and making epic features on your phone this is a very sleek, well constructed phone. I would recommend a cover as it can be a little slippery when handling and you wouldn’t want to drop it!! I just hope Apple continues to make the range as I hear they might be dropping this type of model but who knows what the future holds with Apple.

The A15 Bionic chip inside this phone delivers flagship power for hundreds less than the iPhone 13. And the image quality is mostly excellent despite being limited to a single rear camera. I just wish Apple found a way to include a proper Night mode. And yet the design of the new iPhone SE looks like a throwback with its small 4.7-inch display and huge bezels around the display… Overall, the iPhone SE (2022) mostly succeeds in terms of providing a great value. But next time I'd like to see a design that better matches the cutting edge vibe of the internals.

Battery life is very decent, the phone is fast, the screen and cameras are great, too.When getting this phone, mind most of the old screen protectors might not fit as the edges are slightly curved and the full front protectors would not stick well around the edges - I got my screen protector from MediaDevil, who adjusted the protectors to be shorter and protect your screen well. To cover the edges, get a case that reaches the front :)One downside of buying this device off of Amazon was that they dispatched it via DPD and we have been victims of the false “attempted delivery” where nobody showed. If you can, choose to have the order delivered to a pickup point.

Works the same way as the rest of the screen. In fact, it it only a dedicated part of the screen rather than a physical button. Thus, can't be used with nails or hands in gloves. I know that it is not a major problem, but Iphone X with swipe home function at least provides the extra square inch of screen size.The only advantage is that the fingerprint reader works very well, much faster than older SE. So when you press home button with your finger it also activates the phone.If anyone wonders what my problem is: the SE first generation I used to keep on a table, whenever time or notification was about to be checked, I simply pressed the home button. I could use gloved hand or any object to physically press the button. With the new SE, i must remove glove or use side button which is not easy as the volume button is exactly paralel position. So whenever I squeeze phone both buttons gets activated.I think its gonna be my last SE, as useful home button was the only advantage over the mainstream Iphones.

I never set the phone up so cannot comment upon performance or battery life.  The screen not only had many superficial grazing type scratching, but had 3 major scratches that not only could be seen but could be felt.  How this was not spotted when the phone was comprehensively checked raises questions doesn’t it.At first I thought there was a good customer service as I very quickly got sent prepaid return labels.  The phone was sent back and I sent them a copy of the receipt which had the return number on it.  I checked it had been delivered and messaged them.  Despite being in the same audit trail they asked for the return number.  After repeating the info I then got sent a message saying that it would take 48hrs to process the return.  Just how many returns do they get ???!!!I left it 48 hours and then got back in touch.  I was then told the return dept had sent a replacement.  This was despite asking for a refund as the replacement would not have arrived in time.  To make things worse, we were away so a relative went around to retrieve it fro the doorstep.When I got back I had to print off yet another label and send it back (didn’t even open as I had had to purchase a replacement).  Again I sent copies of the receipts with a new return number.  Again when the parcel had been received I contacted them again, and again was told I needed to wait a further 48hrs ( guess lots of other people had been sent unacceptable phones !)  I did state that it was unfair my refund was delayed due to their errors, but to no avail.  I asked that they contacted their returns dept to ensure yet another one was sent.  After another 48 hours I checked again.  I got a standard response and was told to be patient.I wasn’t, so I contacted Amazon.  Within 5 mins they had sorted the issue and arranged for a refund.Thank you Amazon !

Both the front and rear cameras work as expected, and so far produce images and videos just as well as if it were bought new from Apple. As expected, the device came with a charger, though keep in mind that (in line with all Apple products nowadays) these are now often sold as USB-C to Lightning cables, as opposed to USB 3.0. For that reason, make sure you have a port/adapter which takes USB-C cables, or have an existing lightning cable you can use.I'm also pleasantly surprised at how visibly clean the phone is - after reading a few reviews on this page for the ""excellent quality"" version of this refurb, I was expecting to see a few imperfections. Thankfully though, I seem to have gotten lucky. After a few minutes of looking over it, I can't spot a single hairline crack or any points of damage on the edge/back of the phone. Regardless I'd advise caution if this is a concern you have when purchasing, as this has been an uncommon yet known problem with this seller.The only noteworthy issue I have with the product is I sadly didn't receive a pin to open the SIM tray - thankfully I do keep some spare around my house, but had I not, this would've been a pain to sort out. Just in case, I would recommend making sure you have a SIM tray pin/alternative thin metal item, on the off-chance they don't remember to put one in the box for you.As a side point, it's important to be aware that non-Apple approved refurbishment businesses often do not necessarily use OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. While this is noted in this product's description, do keep it in mind. This is *very* rarely a problem as non-OEM parts - in my experience - work just as good as original, but they have been known to cause dilemmas. Things like weaker screen glass, less water resistance, and weaker battery overall. Regardless, if you're buying refurbished these can usually be ignored for the lower price.In conclusion, I'd personally recommend this if you're looking for a cheaper device but still want an iPhone/iOS device. Whether it be for the icloud, Apple's ecosystem, or purely for the feel/user experience, it does its job, and does it well.I hope this review helped you come to a decision on your purchase, whether you bought it or not :).

I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

So I sent it back and they deducted £16.72 when asked why, I was told that was due to the SIM tool not being in the box(it never came with one) and the battery was charged too much?

While this is just about within their ""at least 80%"" guarantee, I would like it to have been a little higher given the price of this ""renewed"" phone sold in ""excellent"" condition.I contacted Loop to ask for a replacement. They gave me the option of keeping the phone for a £30 refund, or to return it to them (free postage). I returned it. They refunded the money to my card within a couple of days, so I guess they didn't have any iPhone 12 Pros in genuinely excellent condition they could send me.To their credit, their customer service was good.

Mine’s decidedly average and I could see a lot of marks, so the claims are subjective.The screen however was perfect, but more about this in a bit.I powered the phone up and started the migration from my old iPhone SE which has done me well since 2016.  But, part way through this several warnings popped up regarding the hardware on this refurbished iPhone 11.The first was regarding the battery – the phone was saying it was an “Unknown part”.  Then the same warning appeared regarding the display, but more concerning was the next warning that there was an issue with the TrueDepth sensor in the camera, which meant that the camera was now disabled.This is important as Apple got rid of the fingerprint sensor before the iPhone 11, relying on facial recognition (or a PIN) instead for unlocking, and the fact that the TrueDepth sensor is used for the FaceID, this means that FaceID cannot be used to unlock this phone!  That’s a biggie for me and a red flag.The battery issue is also a red flag too as it means, simply, there’s no way to check the status/health of the battery in the phone, so you have absolutely no idea of how good/bad it is.Ok it’s a refurb phone, but these issues are too much for the three-hundred quid it cost.

I ordered an iPhone XR BLACK 64GB. what I had when I initially opened the packaging ( the packaging is clean, no damage, the phone is super safe and well wrapped ) was a BLUE! iPhone XR. An entirely different color to what I ordered. now normally people would send it back, but I needed a phone and I don't really have the time to send it back, to then be refunded 5-7 business days after they received it to re-purchase in the correct color. it should've been CORRECT the first time around. But even though I hated the color, I decided to just keep it and see if it would grow on me. I still hate it.Now, onto the phone quality:the phone itself had 0 noticeable scratches on it, looked completely brand new, fresh out of an Apple store. for £310, it's worth the amount you save instead of getting one from Apple. The screen has been ""iPhone screen ghosting"" ( search it up on google if you don't understand ) which is very annoying as the only way it fixes itself sometimes, is if you lock the screen then open it again, or leave your phone for a few minutes. In some cases, I've turned the phone off and back on which for the standard they claim there offering, shouldn't happen at all. something must be faulty on the inside for it to be so inconsistent with screen recognition. Finally. the face recognition, mine has worked 85% + of the time. with the exceptions sometimes I might have not had myself in the perfect position for it to recognize me. Not many issues with that but definitely have been a few weird moments where it should've worked and didn't. Don't know if that's down to the technology itself or just the phone refurbishment.Now the final section, the battery lifeUpgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone XR. the difference is crazy, my previous phone would be dead inside a time of 90minutes on low screen brightness and on power mode. but on this phone, the battery life can literally last me all day. as I work from home at my desk, I'm not on it 24/7 so some days I forget to charge it and have enough to use it the next day. I'm not much of a phone person, I probably have 30ish hours of screentime a week which isn't a lot compared to other people my age. having upwards of nearly 100+hours. Battery life is 4.5/5 for me

In the past this process has taken 5-10 mins so this was inconvenient as I couldn’t use my old phone during this time either.Aside from the above, operations seem to function as normal at first glance.A few days into owning my refurbed phone - I have noticed Face ID isn’t half as efficient as my old phone. I find I’m constantly having to put the phone directly in front of my face / or many times being asked for input passcode instead. I find it strange that when setting up Face ID on this phone I only have the option to do 1 face analysis, and not the second more accurate analysis which I believe is the problem.3 days into owning this phone I have noticed there is a fault with the camera in photo mode therefore I’m sending this device back and ordering brand new. Doubt I’ll order refurb again.

I contacted the seller to explain the situation in the hope they would refund me the difference, which was about £70 rather than returning it as I couldn’t return it as I needed the phone. The seller only agreed to refund £30 which I didn’t agree with as that wasn’t what I had paid for and now I’m having to use something not worth what it’s supposed to. I would not recommend anyone to buy anything with this seller and believe Amazon should have more of a say on that marketplace. Dishonest seller selling poor quality refurbished devices. Beware of purchases made on marketplace and especially this seller.

(Caps intended and earned!),"I don't normally leave reviews on anything I purchase on here but with this phone I felt compelled to.Firstly, I have to say it took me a LONG time to find and land on this phone after hours of scrolling through hundreds. You see my price range was between £100-150 and I wanted the one I chose to have it all and finally I found this. Now, here me out obviously nothings perfect in this world sadly and you may have read the reviews about the charger not coming with it so you have to pay more for one (unfortunately that's how it goes with newer phones these days. Luckily I already had a Type C charger from my old phone that's worked fine so if you do have one laying around use it! Or if you're not sure it's the right one look which type charger it is from the phone it was from online you'll find it on Google by typing the model of the phone and specs) BUT believe me when I say THIS phone is without doubt the best phone I've ever had and I'm truly stoked that I went with it! I've had just about every brand of phone there is and countless, various models from each and I tell you now that this one for this price range is the best you'll get. It's appearance is stunning and the pictures don't do it justice. It's just the right size in all measurements. It's slick and the display when viewing photos and videos are clear and vivid. I was very impressed with the built in speakers also with a smooth sound when listening to stuff even on a low volume and speaking off smooth the actions on the phone when using it are just that. I've experienced no problems thus far and that's after a week off heavy use. The battery is great but I advice you to keep it at 85% to prevent it from being damaged which you can do in the settings. Once at 85% it should last throughout the day  depending on how you use it. I'm extremely fussy when it comes to devices so I know what it's like when you want them to have certain requirements so if like me you want it to be able to run certain apps/games look into the specs available from the phone using Google again it'll tell you what you wanna know. I've found no fault in this phone so far and it's been thoroughly tested by me already. Its a great budget phone and it's even under £100 without the case/screen protectors (I do advise you to get them as well though because they really look after it and for £15 more it's better than paying out for repairs or a new phone) I'm so glad I took the leap of faith with this! Best choice I've made this year for sure!

While the phone is one of the best I've used, be aware that the stock of these third party reduced models are random stock for use in whatever country they are produced for.  I'm returning my first A15 back to a third party seller I bought it from a few weeks ago due to an issue with some freezing, so I ordered a second one just the other day, that had a completely different seller, and it came to me white not blue, and with  Arabic on the back of the box.  I haven't bothered setting it up coz obviously this one's going back too, since I don't want issues cropping up later.  The seller DID mention  to me that their stock is random.  So I was preparing myself anyway.So might be worth a try if you contact them first or just after purchasing to request a UK version.  Either amazon or the seller directly.The experience from using the first A15 I had from the first seller, was above my expectations.  I don't know if it's because I hated my awful A14 that gave me constant problems, but this is a very very good phone.  It almost seems odd at this low price to have such a smooth and fast phone.I will be buying the A15 at full price instead of third party sellers (once i return the two I have) since I know this model is definitely worth the full price.Hope this review is a handy heads-up to those looking at buying one from here.

I was at the gym dad, listening to music then I looked down and the screen was broken!  I don't know how it happened!The phone was an old Samsung J6+ so it was due a change , it was getting a bit glitchy and as the price of a new screen was at least 50 quid I thought why not get a new one.I was not going to be spending hundreds of pounds on an S22/23/24 or iPhone etc so I gave her a few options that all had similar specs and she picked this one.  So far she is very impressed with it.  it will not be able to keep up with the top of the range models, running on brand new processors etc, but for her, and the average user, it is spot on.Battery lasts all day most days, camera seems pretty decent for a mid level phone, functionality is pretty good and as quick as expected.  Nothing bad to report with the phone itself at the moment.FYI--- It does not come with a charger just a USB-C to USB-C cable so please keep that in mind as you will not be able to use a standard charger it will have to be a USB-C connection.  These are only about 5-10 quid so nothing major.Overall I would definitely recommend one of these if you are looking to spend about 120-150 on a mid level Samsung phone.  I have a S22 and this A14 can keep up with it on most aspects and even beats it on the battery life.  I was tempted to swap my S22 with her A14 as the s22 is starting to annoy me.  The only reason why I didn't is the size on the A14, it is pretty big at 6.5"".  Doesn't fit in my pocket very comfortably if I am being honest.  if that is not an issue for you and you love huge phones at quite a low cost I would recommend one on these.  if you want similar ""real world"" specs but want to spend another 200 quid get an S22, but I would not recommend one of those........My partner also has a J6+ that she is keeping alive, but I think I might replace that with an A14 when it does finally die off........

This phone is very cheap considering the prices of other phones, It has a 60hz display that doesn't look awful, contains most features any other more expensive samsung phone would have, has a decent battery life (can last a day or 2 depending on how power intensive the apps you use are) and a decent camera with stabilisation for this price range (the camera is decent enough that I use it to record my youtube videos and they come out fairly good). The only drawbacks with this phone which may be bad depending on what you need the phone to do is that there is no NFC (contactless) on the phone meaning you can't pay contactless or use wireless charging and the fact that the phone DOES NOT come with a charging adapter but rather only a charging cable with USB-C at either end meaning you may need to buy a USB-C adapter separately or use a different cable with USB at one end and USB-C at the other end connected to a USB adapter just to plug it in to the wall. Other than that the phone has worked wonders for me! I Would certainly rate it one of the best budget phones out there currently! It is so good that I wrote this review using this phone.

All the reviews I read pointed to many satisfied customers.My two year plan was about to expire and to open another contract with this particular phone would have doubled my monthly fee.  I worked it out that I would have paid more than double for the phone compared to purchasing it outright. This is what I did and together with a £5:monthly SIM card I am more than happy. All aspects of the phone are easy to use and work well..  I thoroughly recommend this phone.  It does everything that my daughters very expensive phone does!

Let me start by saying that both phones are exceptional considering their price points. However, the A53 has proven to be a significant upgrade from my trusty M31.One standout feature of the A53 that has left me thoroughly impressed is its front-facing fingerprint reader. Unlike the M31, which had its fingerprint sensor on the back, the A53's placement on the front feels more intuitive and convenient. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference in day-to-day usage.Another area where the A53 shines is its screen clarity. Whether I'm streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, the display quality is top-notch. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, providing an immersive viewing experience that's hard to match in this price range.In terms of performance, the A53 has proven to be noticeably faster and more responsive than my M31. Apps load swiftly, multitasking is a breeze, and overall, it just feels snappier in everyday use. This improved performance has added to my overall satisfaction with the phone.To complete my experience, I paired the A53 with a Spigen Rugged Armor Phone Case. This combination not only provides excellent protection but also enhances the overall look and feel of the phone. It's become the perfect setup for me, ensuring my device stays safe while still looking stylish.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31. With its front-facing fingerprint reader, impressive screen clarity, and enhanced performance, it has exceeded my expectations. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly smartphone with excellent features, the A53 is definitely worth considering.

It is probably worth the £499 price tag, but at £280 it becomes a no brainer. Its such a good all-rounder that I'm struggling to fault it. The camera is excellent, the screen is brilliant and the battery life superb. The only 'so called' fly in the ointment is processing power. But let me be clear... I have had no problem with its processor speed, not one. It's only in comparison to far more expensive phones that the processor falls short. Perhaps if you multi task on your phone and have multiple apps open at once, you may notice some lag. But I and your average phone user doesn't need that much processing power. So the A54 is perfectly adequate for every day use. Also if you are a big phone gamer,  then this is perhaps not the phone for you. Sound is on a par with more expensive phones and is stereo. Build quality feels very, very good with glass front and back. Video is also very, very good. Yes, there are better phones out there for sure. But none in this price bracket (under £300) can compete with the A54. I believe this phone at this price is a true bargin and that's not something you see very often these days.

I wanted a bright screen viewable in bright sunlight, the Samsung has it, I wanted long battery life, the Samsung seems to have it at 2+ days on my usage - I could get 3 days out of the Moto. Quick charge - tick, and the blurb says "".. 60% after half an hour of charging time  It takes 65 minutes to fully charge the device"", which is my experience. . Speed - its lightning compared to my previous phone. Regular upgrades - seems so. Good camera - v. good camera. Expandable storage - should I need it (probs not).What I don't do is gaming, extensive filming and editing and other intense compute tasks.What I don't need is wireless charging, my Moto 30w charger is fine  The in-screen fingerprint and face recognition work fast and well.What I can't abide is the Samsung One UI overlay which gets everywhere. Having used various Moto Gs for quite a few years, I'm used to the clean, unadulterated Google experience, but I think I've weeded most of the Samsung cludge out now, what a pain!Oh, and I don't think the cell performance is as good as my Moto using the same SIM, I seem to be getting 1 bar less especially at home where it's almost zero.In summary, a great phone, great performance, gorgeous screen - and at £230-ish, an absolute bargain, but Samsung software means I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars.

If I used an app or tried conduction a video call the phone would generate so much heat that I couldn't hold it. The phone would even tell me it needs to close apps to cool down. The battery life was also terrible, it wouldn't even last 4 hours if I used an app. I don't mean playing high resolution games, Im talking shopping apps, checking my banking or writing emails. I tried to work through it but it got too much so I had to return it. It took me 8 months from the time of purchase to return it, as I could not get a suitable replacement phone (not from amazon) until then.When I tried to return it, the company that refurbished it, URcouk, said I had to pay for it to be returned, then once they received it they offered me either a 50% refund or they can send the phone back which they had apparently fixed... Again. When I objected to this, they explained nothing nor pointed me to any terms and conditions, they simply ignored my message and repeated the offer.To summerise, I would recommend avoiding any refurbished equipment that is connected to URcouk. Their workmanship is clearly of poor quality and their customer care is non existent and insulting.

My previous phone was the Galaxy A13, which I had for 18 months and I wanted more than just a replacement, but also an upgrade. This phone does not disappoint.Everything runs so much more smoothly and the extra storage has been great. This phone also charges so much quicker. My last one needed a good couple of hours to charge from 0 to 100% battery but this one can easily do it within an hour. Even though the camera is 50mp the same as my old phone, the image and video quality is still superior. The sound from the loudspeaker is great too.

Reasonably snappy performance and good display. Cameras also good. Fingerprint unlocking is a little slow compared to my old Moto G 5G Plus., and the phone also annoyingly requires you to unlock using PIN/Swipe from time to time anyway (holding your finger on the sensor has no effect under these circumstances).If you're wondering why the price is so competitive, it's probably because this is a UAE model (i.e. not originally intended for the UK market). So far the only difference that I've noticed is that there is no eSIM functionality. If this is important to you, then I'd recommend you pay more for a UK model.

For all three of these purposes, I'm pleased with the performance of the phone.I'm sure there are phones that take sharper, more beautiful photos under low light conditions. But I'm just taking snaps to share with friends and family - and I'm happy with the quality of these photos.Listening to music, I use a third party app that I previously purchased on the Google Play store. The app is working fine and the music quality played through my Bluetooth headphones is excellent. I think the sound quality is more dictated by my headphone quality than the limitations of the phone.Watching YouTube and Netflix, I'm happy with the picture quality. I can't detect any pixellation or stuttering of the frames.The phone is also perfectly fine for the few calls I make. It's fine for phone calls as well as video calls.I'm not a picky phone person. I wanted an inexpensive phone that was able to take a memory card (so that I can physically back up the photos that I take). The phone is on the heavier side - but as I usually just have the phone shoved into a pocket, I really don't notice the extra 10 or 20g in weight. Overall, I'm very pleased with the phone and think it's excellent value for money.

Screen clarity of the OLED is very good.Performance is excellent - super snappy for everything and handles intensive tasks with ease.  The battery life is also good, if you are not using it heavily you can expect 50% or more by the end of the day and even with reasonable use it generally doesn't go below about 60% for me.  A massive improvement over the previous S21 model by all accounts.  I don't use fast charge (to preserve longevity of the battery) so I can't comment on that.  Qi wireless charging is my preferred method and very convenient.Camera is very good - I was certainly impressed as a complete novice.  Likely to be more than good enough for the average person.The Samsung One UI actually isn't all that bad and arguably adds to functionality.Drawbacks - No MicroSD card support so go for the 256gig version.  No headphone jack .. bluetooth is fine but I have lots of great older wired phones that need an adaptor now.  It still seems to be maintaining a high price despite the fact its about to be replaced - I would not have bought at the full £850 or so that was the regular price at the time.All in all, one of the best Android phones you can get if you don't want a massive near-tablet sized slab.

I love Samsung phones but unfortunately this model has a problem the phones receiver where you talk through when making phone calls has an apparent issue. The other person on the end of the phone call can't hear you properly as there's an issue with the microphone. You have to speak extremely loudly for the other person to hear you. I was going to return it but I have kept it as it's a manufacturer known fault. This seller is highly recommended for there prices and honesty in selling and listing of their phones.

This is the second one we have in our household now, this time the 256gb version, although such a huge storage probably isn’t necessary. The phone battery life is just awesome, this is lasting for sound 48 hours and still not fully discharged. The phone itself feels sturdy, the screen is amazing. We are definitely Samsung and android fans, and setting it up from an old phone was a doddle. There are plenty of options for phone cases, it looks really nice and performs to perfection. They are water resistant but haven’t tested that fully. The only disappointment (which we knew when buying it) is that it doesn’t support wireless charging but that is a nice to have. It has two SIM card slots if you need it, otherwise the second can be used for a micro Ss card for storing photos etc. although with such a huge memory you don’t really need it. Recommend this phone five stars no question.

In real world scenarios, it matches and even regularly outperforms the latter. The battery life is great, easily a days worth of capacity with moderate to heavy usage. 120hz display is nice and smooth, stereo speakers sound great considering how small they are and plenty of promised software + security updates as standard with Samsung.The only things I was worried about with this phone was the outdated ""tear drop"" style border around the selfie camera, which really isn't as intrusive as it may seem and it missing a 3.5mm headphone jack. Which really isn't that bad either as the 5.3 Bluetooth works flawlessly with pairing and not dropping connection. You can buy reasonably good earpods on amazon for as little as £15.If you're on the fence about this phone, I highly recommend you just get it. It's by far the most well rounded in the price bracket, some other phones offering slightly better features in a certain area but at the heavy cost of another.Very satisfied.

But after reading good reviews of the a34 and the promise of 4 OS and 5 years of security updates, I took the jump. And wow!Pros-The screen. The screen is to die for on a £230 phone.IP67 dust and water-resistant.

It never made it to 100per cent battery in the few days I had it. I tried genuine Samsung cables and plugs, it would not fast charge.  If I reset the phone the errors went away but it would only slow charge to about 70 per cent before stopping again. Once I started to install apps it would start playing up. (Apps like Whats App and Facebook). A quick Google shows Samsung have had this moisture sensor bug for years in some models and have not done anything to rectify it. Technical support told me it was software related not down to their hardware....While it was working (it has now been returned)  I concluded that face recognition was dire. Finger print was hit and miss. The phone was light and pretty but once I had my case and screen protector on there was no difference between it and my 6 year old Huawei. I have always had flagship models but the reviews on this were so good I thought I would try it... If it hadn't been a buggy piece of flat battery mess it might have been ok.

This is the MUCH SLOWER MEDIATEK CHIP VERSION and NOT the WAY FASTER Exynos chip VERSION!!,"This is my first Samsung phone. Before this one I used a by now 4.5 years old cheap and cheerful Xiaomi phone but want to avoid Chinese brands because of the security aspects (all mobiles by mainland Chinese brands are with very high likelyhood spy-phones as any data is running via Chinese servers (hence even the UK government outlawed huawei and other Chinese IT/mobile networking equipment from being used anywhere in the UK!) Despite the great difference in price and given that this model is 4.5 years more recent than my old phone, I can't see any difference in processor speed so was mightily disappointed about my first Samsung phone. It was only by chance, when I read some of the 1 Star ratings on Amazon.co.uk that I realised that I was duped by the sellers!Do not buy this phone if you want Samsung's full feature benefits! Instead of the much faster standard Exynos 1330 that is included in the standard version of the GALAXY A14 5G, does this have the very old and much cheaper MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset that was used in the predecessor Galaxy A13 5G model!  It looks like the dealers are stealthily selling here a much worse performing version of the GALAXY A14 5G that is meant for export to countries like India that can be sold at a lower price for the same profit margin BUT this is NOT the UK version of the Samsung GALAXY A14 5G!!!The Exynos chip is much more powerful which means that a whole range of standard features for the UK version are NOT INCLUDED with this phone. Examples include but are not limited to: there is no equalizer or sound assistant so if your listening to Amazon hd tidal or apple music you will not get good audio quality like lossless. Also I won't be surprised if this won't receive the new android 14 update later this year.Athough the dealer correctly stated the version of this as being ""SM-A146P"", is this 'offer' still highly misleading as it totally lacks any note that this is a far inferior version of the SM-A146PL!

And the screen size is generous. She also likes the tablets colour, which is a pretty, pinkish, rose gold. Working it seems straight forward and has been easy for her to learn. One small issue, is that the app icon badges, on the menu and home page, are a bit small, for someone with more mature eye sight. There are  options to enlarge them a bit, in the settings. But they still remain a bit too small. But she seems to cope with it and we have made the wallpaper a neutral colour, to try and enhance their visability. She has also purchased a cover because the tablet has a slippery surface. But overall, this good purchase for someone who wants fuss free Internet browsing.

However, the battery was getting bad and phone was so slow, after nearly 10 years, I gave in and got this phone, which is available cheaper via Amazon than with 'another well known provider'.  The difference has blown my mind.  Battery life is excellent (mine lasts for days without a recharge), storage for new apps and dapps is amazing.  It really is like walking around with your own personal computer.  And the price, well, this one was amazing too (should have done it years ago).  If you are looking for a very decent phone with many bells and whistles, for a very reasonable price (I got mine sim free, and just popped in my old sim into this one) - then this phone is for you.  NB:  To pop in your old sim into this phone, see the little silver wire (with a hoop on the end - you hold the hoop bit) and pop the length end of the (sturdy) wire into the tiny hole at the top left of the phone to release the catchment cubby where you can pop your sim card in.  This wire/sim tool comes with your phone in your box. PS: Don't forget, for just under 8 quid to buy a quality phone case to protect your new phone.  I got the Kuafcase for Samsung A13/A04S Case with 1 Screen Protector on Amazon at the same time. Would recommend this phone.

This one,given the price and the excellent timing and free case from the seller (thank you very much!), gets 5 stars.The phone is great for what it offers- at £190-195 you get full IP rating for water and dust resistance,a decent camera(s),great screen (big,bright and fast AMOLED at 120hZ, HDR 10+ is missing,Dolby Vision is missing,1 billion colours is missing,LTPO is also missing, BUT at this price point, no phone offers any of those! And besides, the vast majority of people wouldn't be able to tell the difference even if it had it but I digress...) Screen is 4.5 out of 5 stars. Period.Software is Android 14 (Samsung One UI 6.0) which surprised me a little bit given Google's shenanigans last year with missing all their targets and deadlines but anywho... Pleasant surprise. Kuddos to Samsung for that.It's got stereo speakers -not super loud but loud enough with good clarity and a little bit of bass.The battery life is superb. 5000 mAh battery coupled with the very efficient Mediatek Dimensity 1080 chipset and Samsung's software optimizations are a recipe for big success. In my case the phone goes all day long as I'm demanding and use it all the time. For many people its gonna be a two-day battery. The charge is slowish but it's a Samsung,so it's expected. Samsungs, iPhones and Google pixels are terrible when it comes to battery lifetime span and charging capabilities especially the latter two. Atrocious really.Cameras are overall good. Especially the main camera. Not flagship level by any means but flagship for the price with Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS).As for the rest,it's got everything needed except for a couple of things that most people don't care about:headphone jack- old-fashioned people like me know what I mean here ... Also missing is Qualcomm's aptX for high resolution headphone sound (again very few people will notice it so it's not really a biggie...)My only real criticism is that the phone is slippery. Again nothing huge in terms of complaining but just sayin': get yourself a proper grip case and a screen protector.Software bugs will be there as is the case with all Samsung A-series (I know that because I experienced them first-hand for a long time).Camera won't be maintained properly over the years by Samsung despite its claim of 4 years of software and 5 years of security updates promised...but all that I expected.The screen is covered by gorilla glass 5 and the rest is ALL plastic. Again,no complaints here give the price.No charger in the box,just a usb c cable as is the case with all Samsung phones. I'd recommend to get a 30W Ugreen charger as they're excellent and cheap with usb c port just like the one on Samsung A34 and most Samsung phones anyway...I would definitely recommend this phone in the £190-£300 range.Just one last thing: don't install everything that Samsung is telling you when you set it up. Look for the options and choose or even skip it. There's plenty of bloatware on the phone when you finish the set-up and start it,so you would wanna delete some stuff anyway and the more it is,the worse for you.

I used to own a very good mid-range phone, so this is a big jump for me. I would class myself as a techie user, so not a gamer or average user.Firstly unlike others, I did get the upgrade to 512GB without issue. I also got the £100 off directly at purchase. I also got the free 1 year of Disney and I have confirmation that I will get the watch within 45 days. However, I had to do a fair bit of research to find out how to claim the Disney and Watch. That was hard going.The phone itself is well amazing. The processing power is just a massive jump from my Motorola G100. I sheer quantity of toys is mind-blowing.The basics:The phone call quality and reliability is great, both on Bluetooth in the car and on the phone itself. I use data for maps, radio etc. all the time and this works very well (not flawlessly though).There are some fantastic automated features and smart home connectivity which I have looked at and must try.Wifi is working very well and the full phone transfer from my old phone was reasonably easy but the passwords did not come across. I spent 2 days setting everything back up. I did not realise how much I had on my phone.I use dual sim for Work and Personal use. My only grip is that you cannot totally separate these from each other. So you have to be careful when making calls and texting. I am getting to grips with it though.There is so much functionality I could probably write a book and still not cover everything.I am now learning what you can do with the S Pen, which again seems to be lots. I do like being able to simply write a quick note when you need to without having to search for a paper and pen.Battery life is amazing. I find the phone can comfortably last 2 or more days, but I am not a gamer and I do not use my phone to watch movies, nor do I sit watching tictoc or youtube on my phone.I use my phone for smart home management, email, photography, listening to music (MP3's and radio), navigation using google maps and Android Auto, etc.The bottom line is if you can afford this phone, then I think you would be hard-pushed to be disappointed.So would I recommend this phone, well simply yes. There are no issues for me other than the jumping through hoops to get the freebies, but that is not a reflection on the phone.Oh and I would recommend a case, just be careful of the Magsafe ones, I got one and it affected the S Pen functionality. I had to return it and get a non magsaf case.

I'm happy now. the battery is fine & the phone runs smoothly and it is fast and it's just all round a beauty of a device!. So if your looking for a new phone and can't be bothered with the boring look of an iPhone 15 or you just want a phone you can do so much more with customizable wise then I would 100% buy this phone , it's not cheap but a phone is something you use every single day... just treat yourself lol !!!!(UPDATE!) 2 months in and dust from the case has damaged the titanium shell scratched all down the sides really bad because of a bit of dust , titanium frame is supposed to be more scratch resistant but I can assure you the frame quality is awful, so just a heads up , it's not even safe in a case , never had this issue with any other phones even £100 ones!

Alexa, Internet banking, Blink security cameras to name just a few and was worried about how long it would take to swap everything from one phone to another, but I needn't have worried as there's an app for that too.From memory it took about 30 minutes to swap all apps from one phone to the other and the only updates I had to do manually was confirming passwords and the biometric security.The phone itself, although not the latest model as at the time of writing this review the Z fold 3 has been upgraded to the Z fold 4 but I didn't think the additional £600 required was necessary for my needs but that's your choice to make.I won't go into too much detail about what it can and can't do as there are plenty of YouTube reviews for that if you wish to check them out for yourself but I just want to summarised my thoughts here. with the positives and negatives (If there really are any negatives) here.PlusesThe quality and build of this phone are excellent,The display size when you open up the phone is amazing as it's almost like having a mini tablet.The fact that you can mirror the larger screen to the smaller front screen is impressive.The ease of set-up and transfer of apps, etc from old phone to new was perfectly simple to do.The fact that there is a crease down the centre of the screen when you open the phone really does not impact on the screen at all and unless you caught it in a cretain light or ran your finger across it meansyou don't even know it's there.NegativesThe fact that there is no USB to wall plug adapter in the box so will have to buy separately though these days most people have them stored away somewhere.This is not really a criticism but for me, holding the phone in its open position takes a while to get used to and quite often manage to close or open an app by accident whilst im holding it in my hand.OK that's me done.

I'm never going back to a standard phone!!For productivity it is phenomenal. I no longer have to carry a tablet with me or wait to get back to a PC to read a PDF that's just been emailed over. I can do clearly read and annotate presentations and all the Microsoft office apps work well.Plus for entertainment the large screen is great!Game changer

For the price, the camera's are average and  you don't even get a charger. It isn't dust proof so particles can go behind the screen. The screens are awesome, and after awhile the crease doesn't stand out as much. The onboard cpu and ram are fantastic, they make the phone feel really fluid. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have the money or want something different while going in knowing the drawbacks or want to maximise your daily driver productivity. It's cool but not a must have.

It heats a lot, never had a phone that heats before.  Battery life is poor ,always have to have a charger or power bank within reach. Double screen is not that great and rarely used. The phone itself is fragile so you are always careful not to drop it or get it touched or squeezed.  You want a phone that works for you not you working for the phone.Update: The phone now has died completely and suddenly, send it 4 times to Samsung to repair, each time they come with an excuse not to even fix it.

Snappier, and a lot more efficient, which leads directly into point number...2: The battery life. I intend to keep this phone for 3 years, and so from the get go I want to treat the battery right. So I charged it for the first, and only time, to a full 100% on Thurs morning at 6:30am. I'm writing this on Saturday morning at 10:30am, and so far I've had 9.5hrs of screen on time, and have 22% battery still left in it.Once it's run completely down, I'll limit future charges to 85% to protect the life of the battery.As for the retailer - my experience so far has been excellent. Phone was brand new as described, perfect condition and works like a charm, as you tell.Thoroughly impressed by the upgrade, and glad I went for it. And at only £899.99 it was a bargain over the prices I've seen from other retailers varying between £1149 to £1299 for this 256Gb/8Gb model.If anything happens to change that view I'll come back and update.Fantastic phone, bargain price and great service. Great job!

With the same Snapdragon 855 chip.Testing it secretly and it shines performance on AnTuTu, Geekbench, PC Mark etc.The fact it's not brand new I took a risk with, but the positives reviews swayed me, and at the moment, couldn't be happier. A free case and some stylus added to the pleasure, 2 port charger and other accessories is great. The actual condition of the handset (the PRIMARY concern) is absolutely pristine I would say... I've a precise and uncompromising standards of someone describes a product as they have here... THEY'RE RIGHT THOUGH. Reassuringly perfect... Thank you.My last phone was a (now stolen) Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G but this pocket rocket is severely tempting me to replace my old phone of a Note 9 in using in the meantime....

It is slightly smaller than my previous Galaxy A22, and I had issues using the Smart Switch as what should have taken five minutes turned into about two hours. The battery performance, however, is extremely poor. What forced my hand in sending this back is I had 14 percent battery left and called hubby and was only on the phone for less than a minute, when I saw the phone was now at 4 percent, then 2 percent about ten second later, then dead another ten seconds later. This makes this phone unreliable. it requires multiple charges per day, however I did like the wireless charging feature, as my previous phone was in with Samsung getting fixed due to charging port issues, and it's not even two years old and still in its contract. Overall, I think Samsung are making poor phones that are not designed to last.On my previous phone, all of the volume and fingerprint scan buttons were on the right but this phone has them on the left, and an annoying 'bixby' button. However, I did like that it has an SD card slot, as most phones now do not.I've returned as the battery performance is too low, and I don't do much gaming or watch videos much on it, so to not even last a full day on a charge has put me off, sadly.

It has your typical Android setup and layout so nothing revolutionary here, but it feels different in the hand than some other Samsung phones. It's less plasticky. The design is great, I wasn't sure about the lilac color initially because all my devices have always been white, but the phone looks absolutely gorgeous. It's also just big enough and light so it doesn't feel like a brick. (My previous Samsung was the opposite and I kept dropping it.)As for functionality, the two things that stand out are the camera and the internet speed. The quality of pictures is amazing - they are very clear, and the colors are very natural. Videos are also surprisingly sharp even when the camera's moving. The internet hardware gives me the best speed I can get, I have fibre and my router usually goes up to around 130 Mbps, and I got 135 on the phone. On my previous Samsung I would only get about 30 Mbps, and I've just returned another Samsung to Amazon that managed a whopping 5bps.Battery life is also very good. The phone I bought is a refurbished one with battery health at 80% but it still lasts a good 24 hours or more. I don't make a lot of calls but I watch a lot of YouTube and spend quite a bit of time on social media every day. At first, when the phone is installing updates and downloading programs, it seems to eat up a lot of power, but after the setup it goes back to normal. A new phone will definitely last even longer.The only thing I wasn't happy about is the fact that there is no headphone jack and I use headphones with my phone a lot. But I bought a little adapter for the jack for a few quid and that solved the problem.

This was purchased in December 2022, by February 2023 the phone had started switching off on its own. This was only occasionally so my Mother thought nothing of it and thought perhaps the battery had got low. Fast forward to May 2023, my Mum said the phone was switching itself off frequently now, regardless of how charged the battery was. I contacted the seller who was very helpful and gave me some instructions to reset the phone and see if that sorted out the issue. It did not unfortunately. So they agreed for us to return the phone for it to be repaired as it was under warranty.Because my Mum didn't want to be without a phone (quite rightly so, she lives alone and has just had major surgery) we decided it would much quicker to return the phone and purchase a brand one. The seller agreed we could return the phone, which they received it the following day. I messaged to ask if they had received it because Royal Mail were showing that it had been signed for and they confirmed receipt! (day of receipt was 6th June 2023) At that point I thought great! They'll do whatever test it is they need to do to see that the phone is indeed faulty and then a refund would be issued! Well this did not happen, I have been contacting them almost daily because my Mum is still  without a phone. On the 9th June they said to expect the full process to be complete between 48-72 hours. Yet I am still waiting!The other great news they shared was that the phone works perfectly! Which I find rather convenient as that allows them to issue a partial refund. Why after having the phone not even 6 months would my Mum want to return a phone she loved?! When you pay £349 for a phone you don't expect it to stop functioning correctly after such a short time. So to say I'm disappointed that the gift I got my Mum has created so much hassle is an understatement.DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!

Lovely silver colour.  Wonderful purchase!!!,"I wanted a mobile phone which had quick and lots of features, a long-lasting battery, a nice colour and comfortable feel.  This Samsung is the best mobile I've bought.  It looks far more expensive than what I paid.  I read other reviews and the only two negatives seemed to be (1) no charger (2) can't pay for items with it.  As I already have chargers and as I don't use my smartphone to pay for things, I am delighted.Thank you

The give away is the back of the phone, which is plastic and fairly cheaply made on this budget design has clear scratches.  Admitedly they're hardly visible.But, this is a refurbished phone and the supplier has not been helping by lying about this. I used to be a senior director at the UK's largest telephone distributor specialising in phone Insurance and recycling of trade in phones for Apple and Samsung.  Amazon should investigate this seller and stop them selling on their platform.

I often wonder what more do those who pay 5 times as much for an iPhone get more. It's fast enough - although I'm not a gamer so can't comment on that aspect. The memory is enough. The only think lacking is that there is no NFC on this model but my old phone didn't have that either. It's quite large and quite thick by modern standards but still fits in my pocket. The screen is bright and easy to read and the battery easily lasts a couple of days.Linking to my wifi from some parts of the house was a bit of a problem with my old phone but this one seems much better. Android 13 has some nice features over the version 10 on my old phone but it's still quite intuitive.Overall, I would recommend the Galaxy A14. By the time I need the next phone maybe it will be 5g - no point just now as there is no 5g anywhere near me!

I got the peacock blue p30 lite for £180. The phone has great battery life. I can play games and it will genuinely last for a long time (ofc will vary from people and typea of games and apps they use). The fingerprint scanner is instant! Like no lag when using it. The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But its a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models dont get cases. And oo charges really fast too.It does have a tiny amount of lag when there are lots of apps open but its only 4gb and ONLY for £180 its a no brainer. Obviously, there more expensive phones will be better no doubt, but this will do everythinf you want. And it has google play services too.Will update this review if anything changes.edit: this is after a year of using the phone. DO NOT USE WITHOUT A DECENT CASE AS I UNFORTUNATELY LEARNT MY LESSON. I don't really drop phones, but I ended up dropping this a few times from my pocket because of my wired headphones. (btw..go for Bluetooth...less stress) anyway, Yee, it cracked on front and back, I have alot of spiderweb type cracks from the light impacts on the floor and basically the lesson is to just buy a case, the phone is very delicate. But even after the massive cracks, the phone still works which is okay I guess.also, after using for a while, yeah, you notice the lag once you download a bunch of applications, so while it is I think 128gb, I'd say don't buy expecting to throw a bunch of junk onto it and expecting it to be as fast as the latest Samsung. Have reasonable expectations and it will be a decent device for you. It's a smartphone ;-; does everything you probably need from it unless ya a hardcore mobile gamer.

So, I decided to upgrade - and wow, what a difference!I am so pleased with this purchase. It has plenty of memory, a good display and the rear 'triple' camera is absolutely fantastic.The P30 Lite is surely comparable with other mobiles costing much more. At £182, this must be considered a bit of a bargain.Its a ""factory"" SIM Free UK device so there are no nasty and annoying telecom logos or additional 'bloatware'. The power adapter has the correct UK 3-plug and the screen comes ready fitted with a screen protector (albeit not tempered glass). I wish all manufacturers would do that!The mobile auto updated to EMUI (Android) 10 on first power up. I then used Huawei Phone Clone to move data from the old to this new mobile.It did a reasonable job though about 20% of the APPs didn't copy (probably due to the change in Android version). So, it took about an hour to manually download and install the missing APPs. The good news was that device set up (eg. WiFi settings, contacts, screen layout) did copy across.I use a slim case and a wireless charging card. Wireless charging works fine and is reasonably quick.I also added a 128gb micro SD card - so I have plenty of space.I don't play many games on a mobile but everything I have tried works smoothly and well. Video playback is excellent.I have a Huawei Matebook D 14 2020 laptop so I am able to use 'Huawei Share' to connect to and control this mobile. Its great when working at home.If I wanted to be harsh, I could say that battery life could be a tad better. That said, it easily lasts a day and has improved after a couple of full charges - I just bung the mobile on my wireless charger when I go to bed.Overall, I am very chuffed and rather pleased....

So I ordered and then saw that I might have to pay import charges!The phone arrived a day late, I think because it was being prepared prior to final shipment.It didn't come in an original box, just the phone, charger and cable.The phone was immaculate, no marks, damage or anything. Described ""as new"" and it was!The charger isn't branded Huawei but is a 40w Adaptive Charger with a UK plug. It works fine, faster than my p20 Pro.My only irritation is that a standard charging cable was included and so couldn't achieve fast Charger rates. I swapped it with a higher capacity cable and it was fine.So, no Italian branding, no foreign charger, dual sim. No import charges.Ignore the critical reviews from the past, in November '21, the phone is excellent.

Bevelled screen edges means it is sensitive to impact from a greater range of angles than say an Iphone 13 that has a metal back & sides and flat inset screen. Also not waterproof so be careful about that.This is the 3rd time I've bought this model, over the last 6 years. It's been quite painful to replace as being so good it holds its value well compared to competitors. The only real weak point is the sim tray and internal sim transport - be very careful with this as it is easy to damage and can get loose over time, leading to eventually being unable to recognise the sim card.I'm not fussed about 5G so much, unfortunately if you want a 5G Huawei you won't have the Android & Google support and apps. Thank the geopolitic nonsense between US & China for that. It's never gonna convince me to buy an Apple guys, give it up.

It's a great phone that I used to get 2days out of the battery. Sadly it struggles to get a day now. But considering how long I have had it and used it on a daily basis, I'm very happy with that. Which is why I purchased another one. However, the advertisement says single sim uk version (model number CLT L09), which is not what I received. I received a dual sim International version (model number CLT L29). There are slight nuances between the 2, the screen at the bottom curves in the corners on the international which it does not on the UK version. The OS is slightly different and it will only upgrade to Emui 10, rather than the Emui 12 I currently use. This may not bother others, but it did me.  The phone did come new in box and sealed. However, the charger plug did have tiny dents in it around the top and the top plug insert was very wobbly. I wouldn't expect this for a brand new sealed phone. If I had received the phone I thought I was getting this would be a 5 star review as the p20 pro was and still is a great phone but I've knocked a star off due to the afore mentioned reasons.

First the good.Great hardware. Exceptional camera as you've probably seen in the reviews and the UI is easy to use. The screen itself is crisp and sharp - and at a nice high resolution. Phone is very responsive, and I find the memory capacity more than enough for my app needs. Battery often lasts a couple of days, and a supercharge can be done from near empty in under an hour. I like also how easy it is to link your phone to a screen, either via USB C at work or say a FireStick at home. The phone compass is a bit iffy, but generally good enough for navigation and bearings. The finger sensor is slightly fussy I've found in terms of matching the angle you registered a fingerprint at. Facial recognition works well, but as a security feature I would turn it off - it doesn't have the depth perception capability of the Apple phones.Now the downside. And it's a big one for me personally. Huawei's EMUI operating system is set to aggressively preserve battery life. This means that any non-core app gets put in to sleep mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity, and this includes WhatsApp. For me, and many others I bet, WhatsApp is their principal comms platform. If you don't log in to WA for about 30 minutes it stops polling for messages. Many a time I've checked in after a few hours and received a ton of messages in one go. I've changed all the possible settings (and there are a LOT that are hidden away) but none of these fix it. I've spoken to Huawei support and they advised wiping my phone, then suggested I contact WhatsApp for a fix!!  Look around, there are many other posts on this subject. If WA messenger is important to you, then I would not recommend this phone with EMUI 9, at least until they fix this key issue.

Its very good value compared to others with similar specs) finger print reader is spot on every time. It looks nice and is the perfect size for comfort to use. It also holds a high storage memory card which was very easy to install.Cons: the face recognition isn't fantastic... Depends how big of a deal this is for you, this doesn't really bother me too much as I'm used to using the pin.The biggest problem here for my needs is the camera quality. It very often blurs/ smudges and the photos don't come out clear at all and sometimes has quite a large delay. This is very annoying, definitely the biggest downfall on this phone. Lastly the battery seems fairly poor compared to other phones I've used.Still, it does everything you need and is such good value. I would rather pay this great price and have those downfalls personally.If your using it for a work/ spare, definitely worth going for it!

Almost every day I'm finding more fantastic and practical things incorporated into the phone. I just had the latest LG model which wasn't anywhere near as good as this and was 3x the price. This in my opinion is one of the best phones on the market, and I'm including iPhone here. I've told so many people that if they are replacing their phones to get this model. I'm 41yrs old and as you can imagine I've had all sorts of different types, makes and model of phone but  I really mean this, this is the best so far. After using this phone for 2 or 3 months now and getting used to it I'm simply amazed at how cheap it is. Every function works perfectly. Also after using it for a bit now I'd gladly have paid a lot more knowing the quality. I opted for the package deal which included the case and tempered glass screen. I would recommend this as the case is great with a stand that sits your phone in the perfect position to watch you tube or movies etc, the stand part is also a large ring that you can put a finger through whilst on a call making it almost impossible to drop. I could go on and on. If you are looking for a phone in this price range then I can't recommend this phone any higher. It's simply fantastic.

Much better out there at this price point.,"Some things are fine, although having the buttons at the bottom in reverse to the Samsung and Xiaomi layout seems silly. There appear to only be a handful of basic settings in the drop down from the top. I bought it for my 8 year old son to play Pokémon go on the move so that's not a great concern. My main issue is that Pokémon go needs location to work, and it did work for 2 weeks. After two weeks it just stopped giving the game permission to access location and the phone tells me to check family link settings. Nothing has changed via family link but I reset everything anyway and double checked it had permissions, which it did, but still nothing. Google shows many other people having the same issue with location permissions on the phone/manufacturer. Maybe it's linked to the Huawei privacy concerns from Google, who knows, all I know is it's still not working 4 weeks later so is of limited use to him. I bought a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 at the same price point of £150 several weeks before this and I would say that is a much better phone in terms of functionality and user interface. Much closer to the mainstream brands. I chose Huawei this time because I understood it to be the competitor to the big brands which made me think they'd be more likely to have the finer points ironed out but it seems to be quite the opposite. I just had to buy a third phone for my partner and went back to Huawei without a second thought. I've gone Redmi Note 9 Pro this time at £220 because the improvements to battery and hardware are worth the extra I think. They aren't flagship Samsung's but they're not the best part of £1k either and I don't think I use my phone for anything where I would be able to tell the difference. To summarise; this experience has put me off this brand but I may have just been unlucky with the model.

 I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased reviewThe Huawei Mate 20 Pro is hands-down the best smartphone I have ever held, never mind own. It is extremely capable in every aspect and it never fails to perform the most demanding or takes. It will suit everyone, from the everyday consumer to the power user. There is so much to like about it and I would love to share all of my experiences of the device with you with my review of this device.Pros:High-res display2-3 day battery0% to 70% in 30 minutesSnappy Kirin 980 processor2 intuitive unlock methods3 professional camerasWireless chargingIP68 water resistanceCons:High price pointLarge notchBattery: The battery for this device is definitely one of the main selling points of the Mate 20 Pro. The outstanding 4,200mAh battery has been fitted in this device which is pretty amazing when you consider how thin it is and what the competition is putting in their devices. The large cell certainly pays off with heavy usage. The average user will be able to squeeze 2, if not 3 days of moderate use from this device. This is a big leap from other competitors and is just one of the many advantages the Mate 20 Pro has.Charging: I felt the need to include this as a separate topic as the charging speed on this device is in a league of its own. The stellar 40W fast charger provided with the device gets the device up to a comfortable percentage super quickly. Bearing in mind that the device has a large 4200mAh battery, it manages to charge from 0% to 70% in under 30 minutes. This is pretty spectacular and the fastest speed you will find on any flagship device. Personally I found this to be my favourite feature on this device.Camera: Just like the P20 Pro, the camera is also one of the main features of this device. It takes what the P20 Pro did and builds upon it by swapping the useless monochrome lens and provides a 12MP super wide angle lens instead. This is extremely useful and a change that I am personally glad that Huawei made. I find myself using this lens almost as much as the main one as it fits so much into the frame. Otherwise, the 40MP main shooter is super crisp and provides so much detail. It is one of the best smartphone cameras on the market along with the likes of Google and Samsung. This is another feature which defines a phone as high-end instead of mid-range.3D face unlock and in-screen fingerprint scanner: While the in-screen fingerprint sensor is not exactly a step up from traditional scanners in terms of speed, it certainly is when it comes to style. It makes it possible for the Mate 20 Pro to avoid any rear scanner while leaving as much room for the screen as possible. While it isn't 100% accurate, I found myself using it more than I expected to. When it doesn't work, that's when the 3D IR face scanner shows its accuracy and power. It is super quick and generally doesn't allow you a chance to view the lock screen as it turns on so quick.Speed: The Kirin 980 chip is by far the fastest processor in any phone currently. While it may be superseded by the upcoming Snapdragon 855, it is unlikely to bring much improved speeds over this chip. It is blazingly fast and I am yet to experience any stutter at all. It is powerful enough for all games I have tested and I have yet to find an app where it doesn't perform better than any of its competitors. The processor also does a great job of preserving battery by forcing intensive apps to close. The clever machine-learning algorithms are great at only closing what is not used and I found it keeping my most used apps consistently open while closing unnecessary ones.Software: While EMUI is known to be quite a heavy experience over stock Android, I have found the largest version which runs Pie from the box, to be super refined. Compared to EMUI 8 on my previous P20, the experience is a whole lot smoother and a pleasure to use. They have made many small tweaks which overall translates to a much more refined experience. Like always, I love Huawei’s stunning pictures used as themes throughout the interface and I really welcome the ease of navigation through apps and settings. While not perfect, I find the whole experience more and more like IOS by the update (not a bad thing at all!)Price: This is an important topic to discuss as the price will obviously be an important factor for most. At £899, it isn’t exactly cheap however it is exactly in line with there the high-end phone market is at at the moment. £899 is very reasonably priced and it is easy to see how the production cost is so high when looking at the amount of tech they crammed into this device. However, if that price is too much to swallow, I highly recommend taking a look at the Mate 20 Pro’s brother, the Mate 20. This can be found for £600 and boasts many similar features as the Mate 20 Pro so it is worth taking a look at. That also goes for the Mate 20X which has a whopping 7.2 Inch display which may be a bit much to handle for some but attractive for others!Other features: The most notable added feature is the ability to wirelessly charge other devices supporting the QI standard. This feature is a pretty nifty party trick and works pretty well. There are also a couple of other cool features such as the wireless desktop projection via miracast. This is pretty cool and really handy for projecting stuff from your phone direct to your T.V. Another cool thing you can do with your T.V is control it with the IR blaster fixed to the front of the phone. The last notable mention is the inclusion of IP68 water resistance. This means that your phone will easily survive a dunk in the pooling I think it’s a feature Huawei made a great decision to add.Overall, there is so much to like about this phone and very little to be wanted. The whole experience is so enjoyable and every aspect of the interface is so snappy and refined that it is hard to find flaws. While there are small things which could be improved on, most of them are software related which I have no doubt that Huawei is working to improve all the time. These are small trade offs to be able to own arguably the best phone on the market. Hands down the best phone of 2018 for me and only time will tell how this position will progress as we move through 2019 although it continues to steadily maintain it's ground.

Love it, although it does occasionally look like it is trying to copy other brands.Wireless charging - using Huawei 15W fast wireless charger is convenient and quick (although accessory is expensive)Waterproof IP68 design so holiday photos in the pool are relatively risk freeKirin 980 processor and 6GB RAM give reliable snappy performance - never had any issues, gaming or general use.IR Blaster - useful when your remote control is lost down the sofa somewhere!!Software etc - many customizations - no longer need a third party launcherEven the ease of data transfer to computer from phone via wifi transfer (built into OS) is first class and well integrated.Negatives:No case or screen protector included in UK market - this was a big plus with the previous Huawei modelsCurved edge screen makes it hard to find / apply a screen protectorConnectivity issues with Fitbit - Fitbit does not officially support this deviceOverall - wholeheartedly recommended - provided you can afford the flagship price tag.

It was nice enough as it goes, but as I am planning a 4 week trip abroad I wanted something with a better camera.After ploughing through reviews and comments I decided to leave the Apply system and buy this Android phone.There are a few niggles (the prompting from Huawei to let them into your email) for one example, but for the most part the tailored Android system seems to work fine with all my apps.The phone itself is excellent.  The signal pickup  (EE) is very strong in this area.  It is a known bad area for mobile signals, so credit to this phone for getting 3 bars when my other phone (on O2) gets nothing at all!The audio quality is first class, both received and sent.The screen is easy to use, but the rounded glass body takes a bit of getting used to if you’ve used a ‘flat’ phone previously.All my apps run well, and quickly, and I can even do some photo editing in LightRoom on it, suck is the power of the processor.The quality of the screen is stunning.  Everything is sharp and bright.The camera is something else - in a good way.The quality of images from the camera are outstanding.It even has a RAW facility (something only found previously on high end DSLR cameras) and this enables you to access the original (large) and unprocessed camera file and apply your own sharpening, correct exposure errors, etc.I suspect very few users of this phone will actually use this but, as a photographer by profession, I am using it all the time.I have never paid this kind of money for a phone before, but I can see why it costs what it does.A fantastic piece of equipment.

Bargain price I really didn't expect it to be as good as it is for the price I paid its just amazing. If your thinking of getting this phone then get it. You will not be dissapointed. Fast delivery also.

Amazon were really good with providing me with a solution for not recieving a dual sim handset, and i can imagine an employee somewhere has got a slap on the wrist for the error.however the phone itself is phenomenal, and the update to the phone has erradicated all the bugs and glitches someone mentions. i did find that the update did not get pushed over the air, and i did need to download the huawei sync software onto my pc and update my phone that way. i did this within a few days of recieving the phone. since updating the phone has been faultless and i do not miss my samsung galaxy at all.It is a super fast smartphone, with smooth interface. the menus and themes are all customisable and theres something for everyones taste, although i imagine the fact that it cant be rooted will be an issue to some. i however have no interest in doing so.  the camera features are out of this world compared to other flagships, and the AI built into this phone really boosts what it is capable of.i like the notch compared with the s10+, and find i dont notice it at all sometimes ans its very small and central. the screen is good too, and really adapts well to save battery life. speaking if which, the battery is my most favourite part of this phone, as it easily lasts me 2 full days. i like the size of the phone as i can grip it well, although the screen is tall. the breathing crystal version of the handset is a talking point with anyone who sees it, but i do dislike that the camera sticksout quite a bit.all unboxing videos before release showed a preinstalled screen protector and clear back case included, so i was pretty dissapointed that the Uk releases didnt have them included. but i did have my trusted spigen hybrid crystal case ready before I even recieved the phone. ive bought a 3.5 to usb c adapter to use my existing earphones, although it would've been nice to have them included in the box, although a usb c earphone was included.  people need to stop complaining about the headphone jack not included, as going forward all future flagship phones will no longer carry them.i highly recommended buying the huawei p30 pro and cannot think of any reason why someone who wants to buy a flagship should hold back when compared with other competion. the only negative i must mention is that if you want to expand the 128gb memory you need to buy a different format of memory card called nm card by huawei, and it is very expensively priced compared to micro sd cards. most people may be more than satisfied with the already large internal storage though. also ive been having trouble finding a decent glass screen protector for the curved screen thats case friendly too. i must've gone through 8 different ones already and still searching. although i can imagine that being the issue with all curved screen phones.

It was switching itself on and off. But I had the pro 20 for maybe 6 years so was at the end of its use really. I stuck with Huawei as I find their phones quick, uncomplicated and smart. This phone is almost identical to the mate 20 pro, except the camera is positioned differently. I got the phone up and running quickly by use the clone app, and moving what I wanted to move over. I paid £330 for the Pro 30 which IMO was a bargain considering I paid £1K for the mate 20 pro on prep order when it came out. Good little phone and I believe from research, the last models to still incude Google.

Phone is extremely quick and easy to use, EMUI gets a lot of flack but I find easy to use and coming from IOS a lot of similaritys make it feel familiar and easy to use. For those who do not like it's IOS look you can enable the app drawers which a lot of people dont mention in thier hate of EMUI.The Battery gets me through 3-4 days of light use with no issues and putting on the ultr low power mode to enable phone/textand email only really extends the battry if needed.The camera is AMAZING, no complaints. the pictures a clear and detailed and the zoom is amazing, getting some good photos zoomed in. The 50x zoom allows you to identify far away details but does loose quality, but the 5x, 10x are stunning and even up to around 20x hybrid zoom is acceptable. Night photos are simply amazing, a dark night photo outside in a dimly lit street gives amazing detail, light and can identify colours of cars, grass, etc in street compared to iphone i had before where same photo gave little light, virtually no colour, detail and lots of noise at same light level.The transfer from phone software made the transfer of photos, contacts and settings from the iphone seamless.Games run really well and the screen is colourful and bright and resolution is more than good enough though lower than rivals. Can turn down resolution to a lower one to give extra battery life if needed although never really needed to do this. Sadly a lack of stereo speakers and Headphone socket let it down a little but the mono speaker is loud enough if not the best.

I used to hate android phone, and I was an apple user but this makes me change my mind. It's the best phone I've ever had. £500 are a very low price for such a masterpiece like this. Here's a macro shot and a night mood shot for you. The face recognition sometimes won't work with low light but it's good. Maybe on iPhone will be better but you won't even notice. The fingerprint reader it's perfect. Even the single sim version can be used as dual sim if you don't use a sd slot. No problems with Google app. Social runs fast. The audio is great.This phone is beautiful, a big value for that price and full of surprise. Try it, you won't regret it! From a ex apple lover who totally change her mind 🤭

I knew there was no 5G when buying the phone last year but I'm not bothered because once everyone else is on 5G the 4G network speeds should improve for those of us still on 4G (that's my own theory though so don't take my word for it)Just remember to use the phones optimiser and keep all apps and the OS up to date to keep the phone in tip top performance. All in all worth getting the P30 if you want a good across the board specs and performance for a lesser price.

This is my first Huawei phone and i must say that i am pretty satisfied with my purchase. From last 6 months, I was looking to find replacement phone for my current phone. After doing research, i finalized on buying Mate 20 lite. Initial impression on receiving package of this phone was that design is stylist, light weighted and sleek. It came with a manual, sim opening tool, headphones and USB C charger, all in a premium looking black box. After switching on phone, the 6.3 inch screen looks impressive with its 2340 x 1080 resolution. It's bigger than last year's Huawei smartphone model with thinner bezels but has a larger notch at the top to allow for the double front camera. The colors of the screen look natural, if a little more muted than some other phones and the response to touch is really quick and accurate.Face recognition and fingerprint recognition can be used for securely unlocking the phone and both worked well. The Face recognition is the easier of the two as it just works when you hold the phone up and it works well in low light. On back , it has 2 cameras 20mp+2mp for blurring and distance effects with a f/1.8 lens. With Huawei AI technology, camera of the phone weighs more than it's weight and in my opinion at par with cameras of flagship smartphones. Camera app comes with a tons of options and added AI technology takes whole camera experience to next level by recognizing the subject very quickly. The front facing camera is 24MP + 2MP which is gives satisfactory performance as well. This phone runs on Android 9 version with Huawei OS over it which itself is quite optimized for performance. Though, being a first time user of Huawei UI it took me few days to get accustomed with features and shortcuts. Mate20 lite has a wide notch which can be put off for many buyers which is annoying to me as well but it is customizable. Huawei spend good enough time to enhance user experience in their smartphone with great features and one example of it is 3.5mm jack which is a bliss to have it in smartphones. Battery is superb for this phone. I haven't seen any phone with such amazing battery performance. One full charge easily lasts for 2 days. Overall, Mate 20 Lite is a great mid range phone which worth every penny you spend and gives you everything which you can ask from a high end phone in half the cost with amazing performance,battery,screen and superb camera.

Having phone like this no need to have camera phone camera better than proper hand held camera. However with this phone felt like back 5-10 years back. All that spying scandal is shambles. Cant get all apps that you can get on samsung or iPhone. No blanking apps or not all unable use pay by phone directly need to have 3rd party account in order to able use huawei pay otherwise unable to likn existing bank cards or accounts. Unable to connect to the car. At this day and age surely you should be able. Really lacking google play app store. Unable even get proper maps. As much as huawei trying to get all apps that you need, they falling way back and need try bit more harder. So if you want fancy phone to take absolutely brilliant quality photos or videos and make calls and text this is greay for you. Obviously depends from the person using it you might find all that you need there.This is only my opinion.

This review is not about the phone but is about dealing with the refurbishers of it. When the phone arrived it was set in Chinese. In the end changed to English very easily. My knowledge of Chinese is nil and since all of the stuff on the phone was in Chinese I couldn't tell how to convert it. Since I had not expected to have to do this and had no experience of having to I looked at YouTube videos etc. None of which helped due to my poor eyesight and amateurs making the videos. I don't need to go on. I asked for a refund. Then started two days of stress trying to sort the refund with as always Amazon being helpful and communicating with the company to get me a refund. This was proving very difficult and probably going to end up with at some point Amazon having to give me a refund. In the end I resolved it myself and it was fairly easy but if you don't know, you don't know. You have to have knowledge of positioning of all Huawei  symbols etc if the language and writing is foreign to you. Or know someone who understands Chinese. All sorted now. I would despite the problems around Huawei phones unless you're an MP or similar recommend them as the best I have ever used. I would also heartily recommend the Amazon employees who tried to help me....Nil points to this particular refurbisher though, don't go near them. I have no idea how good the refurbishment is as yet but rest assured I will be back to this review  when I find out. What's happened so far is not exactly giving me confidence.

It has a brilliant battery life, a full charge can get you through 2 days, depending on what you use the phone for, if its gaming or streaming you'll need to keep you changer handy but if it's casual use, calls, texts, social media you can get alot out of the battery. The camera is sharp and clear, you can filter yourself in selfies, I choose not too lol easy to use and if your a lover of android you will love this phone, it does have Google play store installed and is compatible with all Google apps. It's easy to use and the finger print recognition is fast and always accurate. I've had Samsungs before that will continously tell you your fingerprint is not recognised, but this never happens on this phone. It still amazes me how fast it is and responds to every action. I can't tell you enough how much I love this phone. Any and all android users out there should have one. All the widgets are customisable and screens can be set up to how you like.

HiVoice doesn't play nice with Chinese versions resulting in AI domestics

It rendered it completely unreliable and unusable. The seller did respond to my messages but erratically and after several attempts to get some support and days later nowhere further forward I reluctantly asked to return the phone for a refund which the seller agreed to. I had to pay the postage (£8) myself and weeks later am still waiting for either an acknowledgement of my return or any refund of my money. The phone itself seemed really good when it was working and I think the one I had was not a good representative sample but I'm infuriated by the seller's attitude and would certainly not buy from them again.Edit - after a number of attempts to contact the seller they did issue a refund after around a month and a half.

I am a very experienced smartphone user (just adding that as a lot of reviews for phones on Amazon are often by very clueless people) and have had numerous Android phones, and I upgraded from a Samsung S7 Edge.It has a nice 6"" screen, but because of the small bezels it doesn't feel large in the hands or pocket at all. The cameras (colour and B&W) are really good, I am an experienced photographer with good cameras and lenses, and normally hate phone cameras, but this is the first phone I have owned where I will use it when out and about and not have to carry a camera with me all the time. The low light pictures are frankly amazing for a phone.Battery life is excellent, I can easily go a day on a charge, and it recharges to full in less than an hour using the supplied USB-C charger.It comes with minimal extra apps installed over standard Android. I can't speak much about the UI for the homescreen as I always use Nova Launcher, but the settings menus are well laid out and have a lot of useful features. Performance of the phone is very good, and the 6GB of RAM helps a lot.Phone comes with screen protector applied in the box, and also a transparent protection case.Downsides:This is the first USB-C device I have owned, and it has no headphone jack. It does have a USB-C to headphone jack dongle which does the job. It has a pair of earphones bundles in, but while the sound quality was pretty decent, they don't stay in my ears at all, they are very poorly shaped with no rubber cover to help them stay in. It has no MicroSD slot, but with 128GB of internal storage that isn't an issue for me.Overall it is a fantastic phone that performs like a flagship model but costs less than half the price. Is a real bargain IMO.

Decided on the Mate 10 Pro coz it had no notch and a 96hr battery rating on GSM Arena.What can I say? Awesome. Very good looks, solid build and it does have that great battery.The Emui skin is not too intrusive but I always put Nova Launcher on for my own customisation.It comes with a clear case, screen protector applied, fast charge brick and some USB-C earphones (and a 3.5mm to USB-C  for normal earphones you may want to use).The screen is great. The new 18:9 ratio that most phones seem to have means it's taller but narrower, easier on the pocket.It does have some strong power saving modes as default but you can soon sort out which ones to turn off. The battery life is really good. After a full, first charge, it took me 8hrs setting it up, with screen full brightness to run it down. Very impressive. After a few days with it being used normally, it easily gets through a day. Sometimes with 60% still left!The audio is another strong point. Using some hi res earphones I get some good, clear audio. I mostly use Spotify at very high quality. I did notice it doesn't like third party equalisers, preferring it's own, very customisable app. Using its own external speakers the phone uses a downward firing port for the lows while the earpiece handles the treble. However, switch to landscape mode, for video viewing and the two speakers then also split the audio to stereo too. Very good idea.The camera is very good, plenty of modes, though to be honest, I don't use it that often. A few stills, when out with friends etc but they look crystal clear.6gb of ram is more than enough to handle the four constant widgets I have on my home screen and still show no signs of lag.As this model has been superceded by the Mate 20 and P20 models, it's now over half the price it was a year ago. Also, although it's a year old, it still has Android 8 so still pretty much up to date, software wise.It's a great phone, that battery is phenomenal. Very happy with this purchase.

Result!,"Okay my LG G4 finally went bootloop after just over 3 years. So I needed a new phone. I'm never that much of a mug to pay more than £400 for a phone if I have to so took a look at what was going on Amazon for £250 to £400. So we had the Nokia 8 which looked great and super cheap but no notification light. Google Pixel XL MK1...great again but comes out of update support right now so no point. The LG G6 was looking solid if a little dull but I fancied a change maybe. Then the Mate 10 Pro was up. Great looking camera, half the launch price and plenty of storage. The other thing was the 4000mAh battery. If I can't change them at least I'll get a phone with a bigger battery. Oh and it has a notification light.Sold!Okay the phone took nearly a week to arrive but hey. First niggle is the charging cable is 18"" too short. The phone itself is great. I made sure I left the screen protector on by peeling the removal tab off instead. Into the case it went. Power on and two updates went straight on which was a good start. I then put back my apps and installed MS Launcher as I didn't want to get involved with EMUI. MS Launcher gives me the most barebones launcher once its tweaked as I want it.I was able to remove/disable 80% of the pre-installed stuff. The only stuff I couldn't was the usual own brand contacts/mail/messaging type stuff. Not terrible I suppose.So speed it great, as is the screen. You can change the screen colour but it comes pretty settled out of the box. The camera seems great though I haven't done much yet. B&W photography does look gorgeous I have to say. I don't take selfies being a 47 year old bloke.I don't listen to music on my phone so the loss of headphone jack is not an issue nor is wireless charging.One feature I miss from the G4 is the split audio levels for ringtone and notifications. Also I have to say the notification light on the 10 pro is a bit pathetic. It's the tiniest LED. Womp Womp!Battery life is tough to call as I'm still in the honeymoon period but it will do me fine I think.It's since dropped another £15 since I ordered it so even more or a bargain!Here's hoping it lasts me three years!Edit - As of Jan 8th, all going well, super well in fact. I got the Android Pie upgrade pushed to my phone about three days ago (about the 5th update I've had since October so not bad). Very nice indeed. Was amazed when the price jumped from the £360 I paid to £699 but seems to be coming back down now.

Sideloading apps from other third-party sites may or may not work reliably, especially if those apps depend in any way on a working instance of Google Play or Google Account Manager.In short: Mea Culpa, buyer beware. It's a good phone if you don't depend on Google in any way. Otherwise, avoid it with prejudice.

Merely place the 2 phones on top of each other open the phone clone app and wait, after about 20 minutes my new Android was virtually he same as my old iPhone X but about £300 cheaper. Thats a lot to to pay for a name!Other than that there is little to say.Sound = *****Build = *****Camera = *****Ease of transfer and use = *****Dual SIMSo far there has been nothing to complain about this phone. If it carries on in this manner I will be sticking to Android.Apple are producing a dual SIM phone this year but new features like this always seem to lag behind Android whereas in the past Apple was head of the pack.Sorry Apple, you lost me...

Huawei P20 Pro Dual Sim.,"Really have loved this phone, since day one.  Poor experiences with both Apple & Samsung, with problems and very poor customer support from both, previously, led me to buying...... And no disappointments.  Not needed support as no problems.. Have used for questions/Faqs etc.. Found support to be excellent with comprehensive understandable answers to queries etc.. Suggestions too based on questions asked... Overall impression is that Huawei Support Actually Cares about their Customers... Apple & Samsung could learn loads!Upgrades have added more & more ads which I find annoying as they are forced until time out/skip option.. That and the political situation with USA are the only negatives so far and I'm almost 2 years in.  Battery is still very good too.  Could not say same for either Apple 6s or Samsung S8 and given this P20 Pro is Dual Sim it does the jobs of both those phones and still is!

Reason I got one myself was that I couldn't believe the price so opened mine before the Amazon 30 day return (before Christmas)... Personally I moved from being a life long Samsung owner but now this kit has literally blown the Samsung's out of the water for functionality and value. The OS is so simple to use and not bloated with non-useable apps etc. So speedy and so far exceptionally reliable. Not a single issue - Turned it on, transferred from my old Android and then it did a system update. Battery life is brilliant - charge every couple of days if that.. I was so impressed with Huawei that I went and bought the Huawei watch 2 (got it yesterday in an Amazon deal so still playing).. Would recommend Huawei if looking for great value and high specs. I'm converted ! P.s. Kids are blow away with the phones too - which is really who they were bought for.

Plenty of space for music. Easy to communicate in various modes,"I have been using  the P20 pro for about 4 months  and I have to say I like it , no what the scare stories about Huawei say. Its got plenty of memory(128 Gig). The camera is as good as some of my point and shoot ones, with plenty of apps on it as well for effects.The screen is a descent size, and makes  WhatsApp easy to use.One thing I don't like is all the Notifications one gets. I know you can turn them off. Kind of annoying. Privacy is probably right out the window. If Chinese authorities have my Contacts List you can betya CIA, Mi6 etc does too. So what the hell. If you are really into privacy, what phone would be the one??I got this to replace my IPhone 5E and it beats it by miles. And no more ITunes. Its easy to load in mp3 files into the P20 without messy controlly secondary apps like ITunes. I have since deleted ITunes and any Apple remains from my PC. Happy days.So, I do like the Huawei P20 for the camera and the music you can load. Comms is easy --Phone, Facebook, Messenger, WhatApp, Zoom etc. Best buy for a phone I've made in years

Display is bright and beautiful, cameras are amazing (even though the 5x optical zoom is the one most reviewers rave about, I love the wide angle camera, which is great for urban photography). The phone charges ridiculously quickly with the included charger and even the wireless charging works well. All in all, a solid phone even though it's last year model. The only thing missing is 5G, but I don't ever find myself wishing my data connection was speedier when I'm out and about, since a good strong 4G signal does what I need quite quickly, so I'll wait until my next phone for the 5G connectivity.

Also I don't use the phone as much as some users since I commute by bike,so I figured a ""lite"" phone (as in no excessive hardware that I wouldn't even make use of) would be a good buy for people like me.Pros:-Really good battery life with proper power management (wifi off during the day, mobile data off during the night, GPS always off), loses about 12% battery in ~13 hours and unnecessary apps closed, though I expect the battery life to decay after a number of charge discharge cycles.-Fingerprint reader is really fast and effective. It unlocks your phone even if you started typing your code as long as you have the correct finger on the reader. I really like this feature because it unlocks your phone instantly.-UI lets you to navigate through your music from the lockscreen (just forward and backwards). While you can do it on Android phones by enabling notifications on the lockscreen, the buttons here are bigger since it's part of the UI.-There is a tray that take both the sim card and can accept either another one or a Micro SD card, which is pretty versatile but in most case you'd just want to expand the memory.-The screen is really nice (the contrast especially) for an LCD screen.-Swiftkey was included in the phone.Cons:-The pin for removing the sim card is really easy to lose.-Some aspects of the UI may or may not appeal to some people. One of the things I do not like is the fact that there is no ""start menu"" to access all the programs you have, everything is on the right of the home screen (Imagine if you are using windows and all of your programs are on your desktop rather than stored in the start menu, because you don't have a start menu), and that you don't have the ability to sort apps alphabetically or by usage frequency etc, so you have to remember where you put them. Accessing swiftkey settings for example wasn't straightforward at all (hint: it's not in the homescreen).Some other thoughts/information:-The camera is decent, it's what you would expect of a phone camera. I'm happy with ~13 mpix, at least it makes e-mail/whatsapp attachments lighter and faster to upload.-It uses the smallest of the SIM card size, you might have to go to your operator if you have older generation phones.-There is some bass boost turned on by default (little SWS icon) which you can disable once and for all if you are listening to the music. If you have proper headphones this option should never be turned on._________Overall I think it is very good value for the money hardware wise. The image quality is very good and I don't have any complaints about the audio quality. I have tried Hearthstone on it and it doesn't seem to lag either, so I think performance wise it is also pretty good.Some improvements could be done in the UI for sorting applications in general.

Which means virtually any recent smartphone will seem outstanding, especially as it was on a Vodafone contract - the least user friendly service provider I suspect.I am still at the stage of finding my way with it, some settings yet to be tailored to the optimum for my usage. So far I'm delighted. Bought it sim free, from Amazon, at about a third of the cost of the market leaders, Android or Apple. Got an excellent Sim-only deal from Plusnet, for half what Vodafone were charging me, but with three times the service offerings. The savings will pay for the phone within the sim contract period, give or take.Build quality is excellent, everything works as it should, 32Gb internal storage I've supplemented with another 32Gb external sd card. Plenty for my needs. 4Gb ram seems to cope so far. Can't find anything but praise for the Huawei P10 lite. Had I been using a more competent phone previously I could probably be more specific with my review, just leave it at - love it!

The phone has a great slim/thin design but still feels sturdy, the screen is a large size, comforting to the eye. It’s easily able to slip in your pocket too. After getting the P-10 Smart I immediately saw the brand new P-Smart advertised at a relatively low price, I ALMOST regretted getting the P-10 lite but after a week of using the pristine secondhand P-10 lite, I have no regrets whatsoever.

I had Samsung galaxy S5 before and I wasnt sure if this phone will be as good.....but I have to say.....it is even better! After I had so many problems with Galaxy S5 and I had few of them, I do not regret my choice.P10 Lite is super fast. You are not waiting for anything. It reacts immediately. Internet works perfect. Fingerscanner is absolutely amazing, I love it (on S5 it didnt work at all). Battery lasts longer, sometimes nearly two days. The only thing not as good as on S5 is the camera. Pictures might be slightly worse, but it is not as significant, and they still look very good.And the body of the phone looks and feels very sophisticated.The only thing I cant tell now, is how long is the phone gonna last for in such a good condition, because I know that most samsungs just starts doing funny things after some time and get slow etc. So I will see.I highly recommend this phone, I would definitely buy it again.

It has a clear, crisp display, a brilliant battery life, and it runs with with minimal lag. The rear camera is shockingly good considering the price point, although the front camera leaves a lot to be desired. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly, and if you're concerned about security, this particular Huawei device is Play Protect certified. The only real flaw is the loudspeaker quality, but I almost always use headphones so this is a non-issue for me personally. Overall, I thoroughly recommend this phone, and it's nowhere near as big of a downgrade as I was expecting coming from the S10+.

The facial recognition unlock works pretty well, but doesn't work in the dark which does make me miss the fingerprint unlock. There's some good security features - I particularly like the ability to lock apps so they can only be accessed with the unlock code which adds a layer of protection, especially for banking apps.

They did everything I wanted them to but my S9+ was nearly 5 years old and on its last legs and I refuse to pay £1000 for a phone that I can't plug my headphones into or get expandable storage which limits you to Xperia and the odd Chinese made phone.I have been pleasantly surprised at how capable this phone is.What I like:The headphone jack - messed with a few settings and was happy with the sound output in the endExpandable storage - which seems to work well with the Google files appThe battery can easily last 2 days in this - sometimes I have gone for 3 days without a charge. Although I must say its not exactly the fastest charging phone I have ever had but I wonder if it might not have better battery longevity as a result.This phone is very light in comparison to my last 2 Galaxy phones - I quite like the extra thickness. Makes it more pleasant to hold.I like that the screen is flat and not curved at the edges - I can get full coverage from the screen protectorWhat I am satisfied with:The screen is quite satisfactory even if it isn't AMOLED quality.The 21:9 screen ratio does have its appeals - most video is in 16:9 but for scrolling through messages or reading the taller screen does have advantages. I could see this phone being really comfortable for people with smaller hands or less strength in their wrists as some of the phones these days have gotten so big.The stock android is quite responsive - I have yet to catch the phone really laggingThe connectivity - wifi, 4G/5G, hotspot, bluetooth and GPS have all worked very well - I speedtested the 5G one morning and was able to pull over 100Mb/s down! This phone gets a similar signal to any other phone I have owned.The dual speaker sound output is quite satisfactory - the volume key has to much range. You have to press the button a lot of times to make large changes.The main camera performs reasonably well - I would say its almost comparable with the one on my S9+ The telephoto and the ultrawide are satisfactory but remind me more of the Galaxy S4 camera in terms of image quality. I did some low light shooting and had mixed results. Had to take a few to get a good photo.I have found the fingerprint sensor to work better than I was expecting. In the last month of using it maybe a dozen times it has hesitated to unlock although I think in most cases some grease or dirt might have been on it. Only 1 night did it really refuse to unlock with the sensor. Not sure why.What I don't like:So far the one thing that grinds my gears - I don't like the stock music app. I know Sony prefer to keep to a stock version of android but Sony also used to be in the Walkman buisness. Could you please make a music app comparable with what the Samsung one can do?Setting up a playlist is very cumbersome on this - every time you add a track it has to ask you to allow the playlist to be modified. The other thing that caught me out was there is no support for .wma files and I found out I have a few in my music collection from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.I also wish this phone had a gallery app that worked as well as the Samsung one but I suppose that's a minor annoyance.Another minor annoyance but I think the headphone jack is better served being on the bottom of the phone by the charging port than on the top. The only phone I remember with this set up was my S5. Its taken a bit of getting used to.Overall I would recommend this phone. I will be happy with this for the foreseeable future for what I do with it. Mostly its for messaging, YouTube, a bit of light web browsing, music, audiobooks and taking pictures. I use it for hotspot/tethering 4 days a week as well. I haven't tried to do anything really heavy duty like gaming though.

I routinely only drain around 40% of the battery a day whilst using it fairly frequently. I will watch YouTube, play games, browse the web and only need to charge every other day. The screen is good and options are plentiful in the options.Only issues are that the main music app is poor, so you need to go with third party options, when you unlock the phone, it can take about two seconds before you can interact with anything and the camera's quality is pretty poor. Anything moving you will miss or get a blur and sometimes it doesn't even save the photos!

However, this handset was unusable and is currently being returned.The fingerprint reader is terrible. It takes multiple attempts to unlock. the passcode option is unresponsive and sometimes does not register presses. There is then often a slight delay when the phone is unlocked, followed sometimes by the screen turning off again. For some reason the delay an unresponsiveness seems to lead to various button presses backing up and then being carried out in succession.The home/back/tabs bar at the bottom sometimes does not appear, so off goes the screen to be unlocked again, if it works.The phone freezes about 50% of the time when unlocked with YouTube of full screen.The phone completely crashed once when I tried to turn the wifi off. This took about 10 minutes to reboot. This was on about day three.I seem to be in the minority so maybe I got a bad one. However, I am not willing to take the risk and will buy refurb of a better phone elsewhere.

And that camera button is just the thing to have.Having the headphone / aux jack is a real plus for quick use, although for longer sessions it pairs perfectly with the Sony LinkBuds I treated myself to and think are fantastic.It only gets warm when charging while actually in use... which isn't great for any battery's life anyway. No heat issues in extended use. Battery life great.It isn't a flashy phone. It's discreet and elegant.An iPhone will seem onscreen to take better images... but wait until you do your stuff with the raw shots out the Xperia 1V, and then compare. I was backstage onstage at a big festival and filmed an act - every face in the crowd was sharp and the new forward-facing mic adds performance.I also bought the ""official"" cover with stand features. It's a perfect match and the stand options ideal. I don't use it day to day as I prefer the simplest of clear, super grippy covers most of the time.So - very happy with it and still discovering features after three months!

So far I have only had to charge it twice in the week that I have had it, the camera is brilliant and such an upgrade from the old one.  And as for the sound quality from the front facing speakers, I'm well impressed!  Admittedly that the sound quality isn't the same as coming from a proper Hi-Fi or surround sound system, or anything, but from something so small, it's extremely good. I'm still getting used to it at the moment, but I'm very impressed with it so far - which is basically what I would expect from a quality company such as Sony.

Worst of all, the phone's connectivity is poor, and it lacks essential programs. The camera application, in particular, has rendered this mobile phone practically unusable.

The ultra cheap and yet useful notification led is gone, Sony did not even wait to introduce a LTPO display... just gone for no good reason.Now, let's discuss instead about what when really wrong with this phone in all honesty and why it is not worth buying: the display, the competition and the price.- about the display, there is no other way of putting it: it's bad. Except for HDR and the 120Hz refresh, it's the same panel you can find on the much much cheaper Xperia 10 V, and even worse with respect to not only the previous 5s but also 10s when it comes to viewing angles. Sony talks about colour accuracy but it is absolutely impossible to see any consistent white, due to the rainbow effect, without moving the device a meter away. Put this Xperia 5 V next to similarly priced Samsung and Apple products and you will realize how bad this display is, it really belongs to a budget smartphone. Absolutely unacceptable.- despite being a unique phone, the competition is not lacking at this price point, both by Samsung & Apple but also some chinese brands. However there is another competitor, that is, the Xperia 1 V. Because for a ""little"" more money and basically no extra weight you get a great display (instead), twice the storage, more RAM, an extra camera and a more refined frame. Yes, it's bigger but not by much, for some people may be a negligible difference, if you can afford it. In other words, the 1 V is a better value, putting this 5 V in a not so good position.- In short, the value/price ratio is quite bad: either the quality should be higher or the price lower. Effectively it's a downgraded phone with respect to the Xperia 5 IV (which could still be okay) but with a higher street price. For this price the display should have stayed the same, at the very least. Or with the same mediocre display but a much cheaper price. The Xperia 1 is (too) expensive, but at least it is very good! The Xperia 10 is disappointing, but at least it's cheap! This one happens to be disappointing and expensive. It makes no sense.Bottom line, don't buy, it's really not worth it, unless it gets a big price cut. But even then, can you live with the ugliness of this display?

I have to lock & unlock the phone to regain any ability to type, even then it still freezes while entering the pin code.  Not just typing, even when scrolling through Instagram and websites the phone will freeze.The fingerprint recognition rarely wants to work.  And for a left handed person (it may be the same for a right handed person), the fingerpad is positioned poorly, if any part of your hand touches the pad it starts vibrating the phone and showing failed to recognise alerts.  In the end I switched this option off because no matter how I held the phone, my hand would inevitably touch the pad and vibrate.I was told by customer support to do a soft reset, this did nothing to help.* 1 week later *The screen fell out of the phone casing, only held together by a wire.This actually temporarily helped the screen sensitivity, and I regained the ability to text/use the screen.* 2 weeks later *Lost the screen functions again.  And the screen does its own thing now.  Opening apps, scrolling and types at random without me even touching the screen.The phone has also stopped charging.  Sometimes it will charge if I turn it off/on.To sum up, this was a rather disappointing purchase, espeically as I have been using Xperia's for over 10yrs now.  I'm curious to know what will go wrong next.

I have a lot of apps on it and the phone didn't slow down at all but the only thing that I have an issue with is that its only 720p. When you're watching youtube there will be black bars and 720p isn't really that great but it will do. The fingerprint scanner is ok most of the time I need to tap it twice for it to work but i use the smart lock face unlock feature most of the time. The battery life is really good because I finish the day most of the time with 20% but if you don't use snapchat then the battery would last you for even 2 days. I would definitely recommend a case and screen protector but you need to be careful what screen protector you use because some screen protectors won't let you press the side of the phone, for example, the backspace. The camera is good it won't turn you into a photographer but you can take good quality photos. Other features that people might care about are it has NFC it has a 3.5m headphone jack  you can go to the quick settings and cast ur screen to a chromecast.

I like Android's OS and started looking at my options. Most of the phones were quite expensive and didn't offer me more for the asking price. XZ2 was an obvious choice considering that the price was around £300. It feels a little heavier than Z5 but feels sleek. The camera is good and has a lot of different functionalities. At first, it might seem like Pixel or iPhone cameras are easier to use and produce better images. However, Sony offers you more settings which are great once you know how to use them, plus better low light images and a much better resolution with 19 megapixels. I like the fact you can customise your home screen with different themes, colours, grid layout and widgets. Another useful feature is the single hand mode. All of those features are very limited on some Android devices that I have used as well. If you are looking for a stylish phone, that does not cost like a laptop (£800+), I would definitely recommend. Plenty of useful functionalities at a good price. Anything else that might seem better, cost an extra £200-400 which is almost another phone.

I always do lots of research and the Xperia was on a short list of 2. I've  had this phone a couple of months now and I'm glad I opted for the Xperia XA2. There are two versions of the XA2 - one with an enormous screen and the one I have which has a 5.2 inch screen so it fits a female hand very well. The phone is very tactile but is quite slippery - the addition of a cheap silicon case has solved the problem and gives protection in day to day use. The camera is fab but then this is a Sony phone so it should be. A really great thing about this phone is that you can easily uninstall many of the pre-loaded apps (unlike phones I've previously had) that you don't want and it's easy to install apps you do want. You can add extra storage up to 128Gb so I have a 64 Gb micro SD card for music and photos. The phone connects easily to a PC with the supplied cable making it a doddle to transfer photos and music both ways. The phone ""talks"" to my Panasonic camera with out a fuss using Panasonic's image app meaning I can view photos taken on the camera, transfer them to the phone for emailing etc and the phone can also be a remote control. The phone is very fast and has plenty of RAM. All in all I think this is an excellent reasonably priced phone at the £199 I paid for it (have seen it at £250 in a well known phone shop) which does everything I want it to do.

Its looks are very appealing, with a great display (especially when vivid mode is on). It's very responsive and smooth, with more than capable performance in more intense apps. The camera is amazing and to be quite honest it's every bit as good as my Google Pixel's camera, with 60FPS 1080p video recording (though personally I find 30FPS 4K to look nicer). Selfie camera is serviceable with a very wide lens. While it only has a single downward firing speaker, it's fairly loud and surprisingly high quality - certainly not too tinny at all. The battery is also superb! With light to moderate usage you can seriously squeeze two or three days out of it between charges, which is conveniently done through USB-C.On the software side it comes with a lot of Sony apps, some useful but unfortunately a lot are pure bloatware. It comes preloaded with AVG anti-virus which for some reason cannot be uninstalled, though its functionality can be heavily reduced to the point of it not mattering.The only other issue I can really think of is the lack of ambient display, but that's not a big deal at all, especially given the price.This is a fantastic phone that has served me very well so far. Never making the mistake of buying a top-of-the-line flagship again!

Ridiculous! A fault in my handset or the build in general? Mic self-test fails when in the case but not when out of it. Simple voice recorder records 'buzz' noises in the case but records fine out of the case.Bluetooth audio is awful - stutters in situations where previous handsets have been flawless with the same speaker. This is without changing any settings.Touchscreen often doesn't recognise my fingers (maybe I need new fingers). I have particular problems on the edge of the screen, but maybe I would adapt to that with more use.Also, don't buy the phone expecting to use it right away - I think it did about 10 updates and needed a total of 5gb of data, and you have to confirm a restart prompt after each update, so you can't even leave it overnight to do it all.Apart from those problems, I like the phone. The design is attractive (what you might expect from Sony), and there's not too much bloatware. The launcher is ok - you can sort the app drawer but you can't get rid of the stupid message count badges.

I having just replaced my mobile phone and bought a Sony XZ1, thought the Sony XA2 looked good for what she wanted, which was to send text messages, make the odd phone call and occasionally take pictures. She wasn't really interested in all sorts of bells and whistles, nor playing games, so this looked perfect. Had it for a couple of weeks now, and it is performing as expected, is a lot quicker than her previous phone, takes far better pictures and is generally a much much better phone. As she has only had it a short time, there is nothing much to say about it other than the fact that when typing SMS messages (and like my Sony XZ1) it is very sensitive and just putting your fingers close to the screen without actually touching it,  can end with unwanted characters appearing within your text. Overall she is very happy with it, and it is certainly a marked improvement on her previous phone. It is a Sony, so has a nice solid feel to it with a bit of weight, unlike some of the other largely lightweight flimsy plastic brands out there. I was lucky in that I saw it on offer in the amazon 48 hour sale, and got it for less than one hundred and thirty five pounds, whereas another well known retailer recently taken over by Sainsbury, had it listed at over two hundred and fifty pounds at one stage straight after I had ordered this one!

Volume doesn't work when I listen thru my earphones, have to change volume on phone.Having said all that I knew this when I ordered it. That's why I ordered the 8gb ram version and paid £330, (it's cheaper on some of the dodgy online shops)not £800 -£1200 and more for the current flagships.Very happy with delivery. Phone performs exactly as I expected or even better!Screen quality is excellent, even with the ageing processor. Sound quality is very good thru the speakers, and excellent thru earphones. I am able to pick out sounds I've never noticed before.Pictures are noticably better than my previous couple of flagships especially night shots. Videos are more than exceptable. Battery is crazy!I charged it yesterday, now 6pm the next day and still has 1 day and 21 hours left!Predictive text (like previous Sony's) is excellent and invariably gets the words right, even when I'm being silly! The shouting matches I've had with the LG's!!! Getting faster speeds with mobile Internet, so internal antenna is better!All in all, happy with the phone for the amount I paid...hope it lasts!

Also, it was very easy to set up, super intuitive.However, there are some major down sides. The camera, for both pics and vids, is distinctly average, with audio recording easily distorted at high volumes (IE concerts). Several game apps run quite slowly as do apps using biometrics. There is a weird 10 second delay when you wake up the phone using the fingerprint sensor where you can't use the navigation controls at the bottom, the pull down menu from the top or turn the phone off again until the navigation icons reappear.For its battery life and ease if use the phone is great but is let down by laggy performance and poor camera.

My current  personal phone i use is a Sony xz ,which i have had since November 2016, and my wife has a xz premium so i have few comparisons that can be made. For the price the xa1 is good value , its has almost flagship specifications at mid range prices.DesignIts thin edge to edge screen and 5 inch screen makes the phone look very thin and tall, its not as wide as my xz but you can hold this phone with 1 hand use. The build quality is excellent seems solid and looks almost the same as the more expensive xperia.displayThe screen is very bright the colors are vivid,Evan tho the resolution is only 720 you cant really tell unless you really look hard. The brightness of LCD really helps and the phone has a IPS LCD this helps with them viewing angles not fading. Im very impressed with the display compared to my full HD xz.PerformanceThe phone is quick and snappy , its good that sony beefed up the ram to 3gb and are using the latest helios p20 quadcore chipset, there was no noticeable lag when playing games or multitasking.CameraThe camera sensor is the same one as the xz, so picture quality is good, the camera is fast, from launch to picture it does under a second. It has manual  modes and front camera is also good, but i would say my xz still edges it in camera.BatteryBattery last me  for a full day , but you can easy get 2 days if you put on stamina mode on. It also has battery care function, this will only charge your phone when needed and at slower currents, thus extending your battery lifespan.This phone also uses the new USB-C charging cable, now you can put the charging cable anyway without breaking the USB port on your phone.It also charges quicker and transfers data 10x faster.ConclusionI think this phone is brilliant it looks stunning ,gives you top specifications, decent camera  and a good display for £229, for most people this phone is all you need, i myself have the more expensive xz , yes the xz is better has better processor and camera ,but your paying £200 more. For most people this phone will do everything you need and save you money.

This issue is well-documented on Sony's own forums (search for ""sony xa1 bluetooth wifi problem""), and there's no resolution being offered that I can find.The ""answer"" is to switch off Wi-Fi when using BlueTooth (not great for streaming music from the internet!) and switch off BlueTooth when using Wi-Fi (not great for convenience when getting into the car or wanting your fitness tracker to sync).  When things do lock up, toggling Airplane Mode on & off typically provides a period of stability.Another deal-breaker should be the intrusive bloatware, particularly the ""What's New"" app, that allows your mobile network to push crap to your SIM-free device(!), and which Sony does not allow you to permanently get rid of.  To be fair, I've used an Xperia before and was familiar with Sony's bent for pushing apps on you that you are unable to set the phone to permanently ignore; however, allowing a carrier to infest a phone that was not bought from them is a step way too far.It should be pointed out that the phone itself is great - the screen is a good size, and it's pin-sharp; the camera works really well, and the whole device is snappy and responsive.  I'm actually keeping it, having invested a lot of time in setting it up and working out how to live with it, plus the additional money I've spent on a device-specific case and new charging cables.Overall:  this phone can NOT be recommended due to the BlueTooth-related flaws which Sony has been well-aware of and is refusing to publicly acknowledge.UPDATE (March 2018):The Wi-Fi/BlueTooth connectivity problems have been remedied through a firmware update that arrived in February; however, the responsive of the screen has degraded significantly.For example, I unlock the phone using the ""Pattern"", which requires a swipe from dot-to-dot-to-dot - this is frustratingly difficult to carry out, because the screen loses ""connection"" to my finger mid-pattern, necessitating multiple attempts nearly every time I pick up the phone.As another example, I use ""gesture typing"", where text is input by keeping the finger on the keyboard and spelling out words by swiping - again, the phone thinks the finger is being listed and usually types two or three short words in place of the intended word.Another problem with the screen that's become apparent is the edges don't register touch 99% of the time; this means the notification shade can't be pulled down from the top of the screen.  The area of the screen where I first noticed this is the right-hand edge, when I realised that trying to use the Backspace (""delete"") key wasn't working.  I've been into two phone shops and verified that their display models have the exact same problem by going into the in-built drawing app and trying to fill a blank canvas with colour - you're left with neatly-defined strips of white along each edge of the screen.I'm going to start the (probably fruitless) process of returning this device that I've had for two frustrating months.  Despite the phone's great camera, snappy performance, and sound-feeling build quality, I'm completely turned off Sony products now, particularly given the time I've lost in trying to get this device to work and the money I've lost on buying a case and new charging cables.

However after day one the updates have stopped and phone is very user friendly now.The camera is superb says 23meg pixel but my phone said 20, still great pictures and film as well.Like the fact it comes with AVG to protect the phone.The start up compared to my old phone is virtually instant from being turned off.All in all a decent amount of features good ram 3 meg and good internal memory in around 300, which can be expanded with an SD card. Note there is no Finger print reader not sure why it is shown as a feature.OK not in I phone territory but at £131 is a fraction of the prices Apple charge.

While I was interested in a larger screen, I felt the iPhone 6 had become too large and almost unpocketable (and add to that its bendability). Having recently compared both phones, I personally find the Z3 compact much nicer to hold - the plastic/rubber edge and the fact that it is a little bit thicker means it is much less likely to slip out of your hand if you're not using a case. The phone is roughly the same size as the iPhone 5/5s, but slightly wider.Making the switch from IOS to Android has taken some getting used to, but within a few days I have managed to set up the phone to my liking. What I dislike is the bloatware installed by Sony, but fortunately you are able to hide away most of this software - the majority of which I won't use. The camera and Walkman apps are good though and I appreciate the ability to shoot in manual mode and change settings. Other review sites have said that the iPhone 6 camera is considerably better than the Sony Z3, but as I have a proper camera I only sporadically use a phone camera and I feel it would be up to the task if I did happen to come across a must-shoot opportunity. The wide angle of the lens is definitely appreciated.Another big attraction of the phone is its battery life. This had been particularly poor for me on the iPhone 4s and I believe it remains the case with the iPhone 6 (with Apple favouring the thinness of the device over better battery life). As a light/medium user I can easily make the Z3 compact last for two days with still 25% to spare.I am very satisfied with the screen and given that it is a 4.6"" screen I am glad that they have gone for 720p rather than full HD (this likely to have a negative impact on the battery). It is a very fast phone and you do not notice any lag at all. Definitely a step up from the 4S, which has become quite laggy for me.Taking into account its specs - which are on a par or in fact slightly better than the iPhone 6 - and its price point, I think the Z3 compact is a no brainer.

The long and the short answer is yes. The least I have got from it is just over 38 hours or so and this is when I was using it constantly- Kindle, Audible, Spotify, Camera and general fiddling to get used to the phone. On the current cycle, with a bit less use but still some tinkering and watching of videos on Youtube etc, it's at 2 days, and 9 hours- admittedly it's on 1% and about to die but I think that as smart phones go, with the specs the Z3 has, this is impressive. I have my phone on Stamina mode and wifi only activates when it picks up a known network which also helps with battery consumption.Have a nano sim ready so you can use it straight away. I knew it took a nano sim so I had that before the phone itself arrived. Easy to get it swapped over. I am with O2 but I would guess the process would be similar with other networks.I had wanted the aqua phone but was not prepared to pay the full price from Carphone Warehouse and I had a number of amazon vouchers to use.I may compromise and get the aqua phone cover when it is released but happy with the cover I have at the moment and the aqua phone cover is pricey.I agree with the bloatware comments but having come from a Samsung, I can't say this bothers me too much- I just ignore it.I have not experienced any over heating at all. Any warmth I have felt I think has more to do with my own body heat when I hold it for prolonged periods of time than anything else.Sound quality is impressive from the phones speakers and also with earphones plugged in. No tinniness at all and a good bass. I had an S3 mini previously and it blows this out of the water when it comes to sound quality which doesn't surprise me in the slightest.The camera is incredible. It's fast and takes incredible shots. So much so that a friend of mine I was chatting to via what's app and sending images to asked what phone I had as it took amazing photos.I haven't noticed any lag at all. It is extremely fast. I hit a key and it does what I want it to do immediately. No momentary pause- just straight to it.The screen is nice and sharp. If you would like a screen protector (I highly suggest you do for some extra protection), I recommend the same ones as Beanie: 6x Savvies SU75 UltraClear Screen Protector for Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803. The phone itself is super sleek and great for use in one hand. For me it was never a question of going for the Z3 over the Z3C as I just don't like big phones and the marginally better screen and slightly higher specs were not enough to entice me.For a bit of extra grip, I'd recommend one of the silicon phone cases (Yousave Accessories Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Case Black Silicone X-Line Cover). The smoothness of the phone did make me paranoid I would drop it but I don't think I would have done.The silicon case adds a bit of grip that eradicates this feeling without adding bulk to the phone and detracting from how streamline it is.I have purchased a magnetic USB charger for less than £3 from ebay that works a treat. I don't feel that the flap over the USB socket would wear out but for £3, better safe than sorry.I honestly can't fault it. I tend to take very good care of my electronic gadgets. I have friends and family that just have to look at their phone and it gets scuffed! I can see me having this for a good few years.5 stars after 2 weeks of use but should any issues/faults crop up I will most definitely be back to update this review.*****UPDATE 20/10/2015*****I lost my phone and got a replacement through my insurance in January. I wanted to update this review to say that the headphone jack has started to play up. As long as I keep the phone still and don't knock the headphones close to where they are plugged in, it's fine but if you do knock it, which is easy to do, the sound cuts out. This is annoying as I use Spotify a lot to listen to music. I imagine I have just been unlucky as I went 9 month with this particular phone with no issues but wanted to update my review accordingly.

This is the first time they have let me down! Bought as a replacement for my last Sony phone that lasted over 2 years of pretty rough life as I used to work as a welder. High temperatures, sparks and spatter, being dropped and all. It eventaully had an occasional screen fault that meant 1/3 times the phone didn't respond to touch. The battery also wasn't lasting as long as it used to so I decided it was time for a replacement.As soon as this phone arrived I knew it would be a disappointment. Something inside the phone would rattle/shake as you picked the phone up. The touch screen was worse than my very broken old phone, and the battery didn't last as long either!I thought I'd give it a few months but the frustration continued. Regular crashing and all sorts of other annoyances made me consider going back to my old very broken phone. I've now been forced to go back to my old phone as the charging port on the new one overheated and melted, meaning it's useless. Will try to get a warrantee claim in, but won't hold my breath!How have Sony even been able to release a phone this useless?

This is my first glass bodied phone.  It's incredibly slippery.  I now appreciate why half the population owning mid and high end smartphones have cracked screens.  So after initial inspection and set up I put it back in the box and ordered a gel case and since it arrived and was fitted the phone is as good to hold as any cheap plastic phone!The good stuff:  nice display, very legible.  I'd have preferred a 16:9 ratio but the fashion gods and their marketing devils don't cater to normal people or reality.  It's *just* compact enough to use one handed by a 5'10 male with  average size hands. The fingerprint sensor is just like on the older XZ series, i.e. ideal.  The volume buttons are in the right place.  The sound quality with suitable earphones is impeccable., though the output impedance seems to be somewhat higher than 1 so you might get an uneven response with balanced armature  IEMs.  The GPS is excellent, really fast & accurate.  All the networking stuff including NFC & Bluetooth works perfectly.  Battery life is certainly better than the old XZ series.Sony's version of Android is almost identical to Google's so everything works just how you'd expect. No pointless duplication like Samsung and no crazy menus or annoying bugs like Xiaomi.  It's very slick.It's waterproof!  My old XZ1 is also waterproof and this has saved the day in the past with a very unfortunate bathroom related incident.  Uuugh.It accepts my 1TB Sandisk microSD card and works perfectly with it.Call quality is fine, no problems at all.I'm not sure about the camera yet.  It seems very good but Sony haven't packed this line of phones with their excellent Album app or 3D image creator and their other excellent photo related stuff.  I'm finding using the camera a bit slow compared to the XZ1.The phone is getting regular security patches.  How long this will last is uncertain.  When I bought my XZ1 Sony had promised two full Android upgrades and security support but they disgracefully reneged on this after the first full upgrade.  I stuck with Sony specifically because by buying this model retail instead of from a network, I get a phone with unlockable bootloader and support of the Sony Open Devices Project so it won't become redundant after getting its final official upgrades/updates.Overall it's a nice phone that is just compact enough for people who really don't want a two handed behemoth.  It's very practical due to being waterproof, has everything you need for Google Pay, doesn't have any irritating bugs or ""extra features"" and does everything very well.  Stick a gel case on it so it doesn't shoot out of your hand like a bar of soap and it's very easy to live with.

I don't play games much, the phone is used mostly for calling, texting and internet browsing.

Sony,Sony Xperia L1 SIM-Free 16GB Smartphone - Black,,https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-Xperia-L1-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Black/dp/B06Y64TBHP/ref=sr_1_35?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mssQpYtAvDhiVpcVJviyIUQWh5EG84kPZQ7SEAplRkJKa4bDK7BDa9OGJ57Z3Bt6ANXbD1TUegsH7s9DqqYxdDCi1PehkJkA1GvFhSGhmScbxSDNSBbW9KTJkwW4XD2yDej3aWMRzJV1CHPdniJiH9-Xitb2Yo4awcHblGtioRwckXr9liE60tWOBIFLhKigKleALJmRbi4HzAUNWOeaWu7D0MQ8h4TnPOcCh1WLpCdBI9ITUytvHdQ87JviOxi03jV3VMmcwnJQzjuGzc2y0w7UN0np7eRX-Fr6vxEZqd0.JH0HApzN0hHCSbbTUC6504icFS0tZOuD5o2Ccc2rzjE&dib_tag=se&qid=1714768823&refinements=p_89%3ASony&rnid=1632651031&s=telephone&sr=1-35,Quality as expected from Sony,"I like Sony products so decided to take the plunge with the entry level Xperia (so the camera has an inferior lens) but I wasn't really bothered about that. Anyway, the phone is great and having used Windows Phone for years I was coming over to Android and the OS on the whole is better in the sense that it is far less sluggish. I'm now able to complete tasks such as web browsing much quicker than I could have with my previous phone.The most impressive feature of the phone besides the design (which I really like with the feeling of the back cover which is less likely to slip out of your hand although I'd recommend a case), is the battery life where the phone will last for days if not heavily used. Even if you watch some videos it can last for quite a while although it depends on how long you're watching videos. If there's a negative of the Xperia it is that it's stuffed with useless apps that are hard to remove. The default space is almost taken up by 50% with apps but you can always upgrade the memory if needed.If you're looking for a mid-range phone that doesn't have too many advanced features you will be happy with the Xperia. It does the job or at least it does in what I'm seeking in a phone which is the basics such as calls and texts with a few extras. It can do anything pricier competitors can but just less of it or at an inferior standard such as with photos. If you need a phone for pictures you're much better with the more expensive model but for everyone else it will work just fine.

This phone seemed a good beginners phone for someone not familiar with Android and frightened of it.  It also gave me the opportunity to familiarise him with my XZ Premium phone on the basics before the L1 arrived.  After not wanting to change his phone ever because he liked the one he already had, after only a few weeks he now says the L1 is the best phone he's had and wishes he'd changed sooner.  There you go, sometimes you just need to take the plunge.As another reviewer pointed out, this phone does take a nano sim card, so those who purchase this phone, if not already using a nano sim, need to contact their Service Provider to supply a new.  Having read details and reviews we were ready and waiting with a new sim card before the phone arrived so we could set up straight away.Having purchased another Sony phone in the last year, it seemed pretty straight forward.  No info in the box, but that is quite common these days, but the Xperia Assistant on the phone directs as part of the set-up process.  It does tell you you can transfer all your old phone stuff from Windows Phones to Android or from Android-to-Android.  However the option to transfer from Windows was fiddly as not an automatic transfer;  I had to do a bit of Google research on how to do this successfully.  Thankfully we will never go back to using a Windows phone so will never be a problem again the hard work is done now.The phone doesn't have a lot of memory and it is taken up with apps that you may not need (and can only disable and not remove), but I've just put in the memory card from the previous phone and bulked it up.For beginners, you can customise it so everything you use is on the main screen.The phone comes pre-loaded with free AVG anti-virus, though we chose to boost this up with a paid-for app similar to our laptop and tablet as you can never be too careful.Not being a high phone user the battery will lasts anywhere between 2-3 days.  The charger that came in the box consists of a USB cable that connects to a separate plug.  So you can use the USB to plug into your laptop and charge via that if it is switched on, or alternatively you can put the plug on one end of the USB cable and use a regular wall plug socket.Switch on/off is quick and the operating is pretty good too and doesn't seem to have any lags.  Surfing the internet and opening webpages is quick.As it is more of an entry level phone, there isn't a scanner on or finger recognition (nor does it come with any earphones/buds).  You get what you pay for, and for most people they don't really want all the fancy additions.  The camera pixels forward face and back are very good.  There does seem to be a  bit of a delay when pressing the button to take a photo and it actually taking the photo.  My XZ is the same so may be a common and normal for all Sony phones across their whole range.  It does not cause a problem once you know and adapt.Phone size isn't too small or too big and fits in the hand comfortably.  Screen is very clear and the colours are excellent.  I purchased the OMOTON Screen Protectors for this phone to prevent damage.  A must-have if you drop your phone.  The tempered glass of the protectors mean not only do they fit snug on the screen, the smooth glass ensures that you can glide across the screen without any drag or sticking (no need for a stylus).  Combined this set-up with a Terrepin Black/Tan full case (all purchased from Amazon) to make the phone safe from damage.Overall the phone is easy to use.  From out of the box to in-use it was approximately 1 hour.  All the apps required were downloaded from PlayStore, email set up, personalisation, etc.  Had I not had the issue with transferring from Windows and having to Google the procedure, it wouldn't have taken that long at all.Based on my experience with hubby's phone.  If I could turn the clock back for myself, I probably wouldn't have been a phone-snob and bought my XZ Premium model and would have purchased this L1 instead as it has all the features I need and excellent value for money.I understand that this phone is being discontinued.  So if anyone is looking for a phone that doesn't want all the fancy stuff, but good in every other respect, go for this phone while it is still available.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

I am currently using a sony xz and in our household we have a z5 and a xz premium. The 1st impressions of this phone , are positive the phone feels solid and well built it actually feels more expensive then its price dictates .I have compared it to my xz which cost £500 , for phone that costs 169 its fairly good and does most tasks well , multitasking , camera, screen display are above average. The 5.5 display produces decent quality pictures and colors , the phone is quite responsive and only slightly lags when multitasking,  For me the xz is still way ahead in terms of performance, the camera is average but for £169 this good value, if i didn't use a high end phone then i could quite easily get use to this phone.  If your on a budget your getting big screen android phone with android  nougat for a 3rd of the price of a flagship, yes the xz and xz premium are way ahead in terms of performance but you have to pay for it , but the L1 gives you a great experience for those on atight budget.

The general performance when running apps is reasonably slick, but I've noticed a few annoying quirks as time has gone on.The bluetooth fails to reconnect with paired devices about 50% of the time which means re-pairing with the hands free kit most days.My ear will often activate functions on the screen mid-call. I actually deleted an important voicemail by accident this way! After numerous other smartphones never having this type of issue this was really annoying.The camera functions are disappointing when compared with my last phone which was also a budget model (Samsung Galaxy Core Prime).Finally, this is the first smartphone I've had which does not have a physical 'home' button and I'm surprised how such a small feature proves so annoying.In summary, the phone will probably be fine for someone who wants a cheap, slick smartphone, but if you make a lot of calls it might be best to look at the alternatives.

Very  premium Iphone feel to this product when you swipe and move between apps and functions which to me just oozes in class. The screen is extended but not visibly wrapped around edges like galaxy S6/7 but enough to extend field of view and add an extra quality to this product. The 5 inch screen really makes the phone feel like just holding a screen a times as other than on/off aux and volumne buttons down the side all the functions like home screen button are in the software.  The phone is big enough to watch now tv or netflix from but still maintains that pocket size something I always look for in a mobile.  A back high quality video and camera and a passable front camera is making me consider why the hell I bought a £300 digital camera recently, there was just no point in having both . The connectivity and communication between apps/ emails and general day to day functioning of this phone is great and couldn't hope for more so far although its only been a few days since I've connected it up to my emails, social media's etc but owning a ps4 means I can take full advantage of a neat little PS4 app which links my phone to the system and visa versa.Negatives: I've only had the phone a few days so the negatives so far around limited to what I already know about the product. I know at some point I will need a micro sd card, I also know at some point it will crack, lets face it they all do so defiantly need to get a casing and a screen protector to delay the inevitable. The back of the phone is liable to finger print smudging buts that probably because this isn't a fully metallic back probably Sony cutting costs, but its still a premium feel and look none the less. The placement of the function buttons on side of phone is lower and will take some getting used to and the power button sticks out slightly, not had a problem yet but I Imagine it could at some point pocket-turn off. I'm not convinced the battery life is all that but I was excessive downloading apps yesterday and had 10's or so running in background. It does however charge very quickly especially with their quick charger gimmick which takes just 10 minutes or so to get to 50%.All in all I think I saved £350 or so in not getting an Iphone. But you get what you pay for, this a premium feeling phone with powerful specs/HD and actually it looks a lot better in person than the picture gives it credit for. But be realistic with these reviews as it is at the more affordable end of the smartphone range but I could easily pass this off for a £400 mobile to friends (if I cared that much) and for a simpleton like me this handy peice of kit at  a 3 star price is leaps and bounds ahead of my old smartphone from 2014 even running from a similar android system. I've added two recent photos to this review from the back camera. Fingers crossed I have the same views in 6 months time!

Everything on the screen is ideal and easy to use.I have fitted a Micro SD card which provided me with much needed extra memory which I would also recommend as with the many apps this phone can use because of the excellent and fast processor.Everything about this phone is First class and from the workings of the phone to the actual attractiveness of the phone, this is certainly a phone which stands out in the crowd.Why I like this phone is mainly the ease of use, everything about it was straightforward.  It has some excellent apps which come under the heading ""Introduction to Sony"" along with many more apps exclusively for the Sony Xperia range which provide many hours of fun and relaxation.I love this phone for the main reason it is first class throughout, and that includes the look and workmanship of the phone.  Everything about the phone is quality,The one main item I love about the phone is how quick I can get the camera to take a photograph, it is the simple task of pressing the small button required and I am ready to take a photograph which is especially important when those moments surprise us and I know it is a moment I want to photograph.  In the past when I would take a photo using my Smartphone by the time I got the phone working the moment would be long past.  The photographs are exceptional and this is another reason I love this phone is how clear and wonderful they are, with the added advantage with a swipe of the finger I can go from still photographs to video in seconds which makes this phone special.There is an app called the Album which holds all those memories and with the added advantage this has so many hidden extras I do not believe I will ever get to know them all!I love this phone and I am so pleased with my purchase, from the audio qualities, the ease of use and the presentation this is a phone which will hold it's own in the Smartphone world.I am happy to recommend the Sony Xperia XA UK SIM-Free Smartphone(White) as a top quality phone which comes top of the class in every category which matters to me as a customer who certainly needs a phone which works with speed and top quality sounds throughout.

This is a superbly designed smartphone with metal case and curved-edge screen - similar to the iPhone 6/7 and Samsung S7. It's larger than the former though and fits well in the hand while still having a bright, clear 5-inch screen. The product photos are a little confusing though because that strange lock-screen is actually just a glimpse of the sideways motion the unlocking swipe takes, and the colourful paintbrush swirls are the wallpaper underneath (easily changed).The instructions say charge for 30-mins before first use, so I did. And if it's like mine then proceeds to update itself, all the way up to Android 7 Nougat.In use the phone is responsive and handles everything thrown at it. I've read reviews of the heat generated by the latest Sony's but have to say I haven't noticed it. That big initial upgrading - which overall took quite a while - didn't make the phone any warmer than any other I've had. In fact I'd say it became only slightly warm. Certainly nothing out of the ordinary.So far I'm down to 50% after that original charge 5 days ago, so there's no battery problem either. True I don't sit glued to it all day like a teenager and turn it off at night. From previous experience of other phones I'm quite happy.The box is Sony's new style - less flat and more boxy. You get the phone, a USB cable and adaptive fast charger (UCH10) and a couple of leaflets. That's all. So no earphones.The SIM is a Nano-sized one and it fits in a single pull out tray alongside a memory card if you choose to use one.On Sony's web-site you'll find a full PDF manual and the ""Xperia Companion"" desktop software for both Windows and macOS if you'd like to use that. For Windows users only there's the ""Media Go"" music and video player available too. An alternative to the like of iTunes etc. None of this is needed though.All in all the phone doesn't disappoint. I've owned Sony phones before and they just keep getting better. I've owned iPhones too but keep coming back to Sony.A good buy from a quality brand.

I would definitely recommend.,"I originally had a Samsung J5 but had to buy another phone as the internal memory was only 4GB and it started to get full pretty quickly even though I only purchased it 6 months previously. I looked through all the reviews of different makes of phones on Amazon. The internal memory needed to be larger I decided on 32GB. I looked at many models but read a review of this Xperia model. Many reviewers said that it was a lovely phone. The camera was good - I watched a film on YouTube about this phone and people said that the camera was adequate I didn't need a top of the range one as I don't take my phone on holiday - I take my fuji camera with me.I originally didn't think I needed the news application that was already downloaded on the phone but now I am continually reading this as I like to keep abreast of what is happening in the world.I love the fact that you can change the lock screen and home screen wallpapers. I have downloaded two wallpaper apps -  Bagrounds and HAD wallpapers  along with Zedge. The Zedge app is brilliant as the Expedia X phone allows you to change the icons using Zedge like for example, the original icons the camera, calendar, phone and the message app to name but a few. You can install another weather app even though there one already installed. The applications that are already installed on the phone fresh out of the box can not be removed but can be disabled which is better than most phones of this price It is fine for me but it would be even better if you could completely uninstall them. It does free up space though.Playstore is of course installed​. The home screen panel takes about of getting used to as you can add more panels and it works slightly different to the Samsung phones  it I feel it is better as you can change the order of your applications to suit you.There are other applications that are pre-installed that I have never come across before such as TrackID which tells you what you are listening to. What's New gives you more theme to download. The Lounge is worth keeping as it gives you competitions to complete.It has it's own protection AVG where you can scan it for threats I'm not to sure if it runs out and you have to buy it I have yet to look at that - I have  security on my Acer Tablet and I can add my phone to it. AVG is a good security app so that is up to you if you keep it.I really like this phone I would definitely recommend anyone to buy it. I did intend to buy another Samsung but as there was trouble with their phone batteries I decided to go with a different brand and I am glad I did. This  Xperia is lovely. I did look at other models of the  Xperia range but this model came with the right specifications that I needed.

Dropped it a bunch of times onto tiles - with a hard shell on because I am not stupid and I keep a case on it all the time - with no problems with screen breakage or any kind of damage. Sony make very tough phones in a sleek, even pretty form. Fingerprint sensor works great and I remember my PIN as an alternative security because why wouldn't you? With the latest Android it's easy to turn off all the annoying Sony garbage if you don't want it - personally I really appreciate the Walkman music player and I'm sure other people would like at least some of the other guff Sony load for your convenience. My mates all have Apple phones and they all think this phone is nicer to look at and hold. What more can I say, buy one.

The Xperia Z5 Compact is pretty much just that. This Z5 Compact replaced my Z1 Compact so I'm sold on how great this range is. Why?- Great size, fits in pockets with ease, and can be used with one hand.- Performance is snappy and doesn't get bogged down with lots of apps left open.- Camera is decent; it might have 23 megapixels, in intelligent auto, you get 20 MP (although by default it's set to 8) but images can get noisy indoors.- Waterproof doesn't mean you have to go swimming with it (although I have), but even for day to day things like when my toddler grabs my phone with sticky fingers I can run it under the tap rather than getting my knickers in a knot.

But during normal browsing/usage it gets noticeably warm and when I tried a 4k video (once I got past the ""This device might overheat and shutdown"" warning) it got really warm, really quickly. A browse of internet and there are a lot of sites complaining about the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor getting hot. I'd read a few reviews that mentioned this but thought it was for heavy download/gaming - not what I'd planned to use phone for. But it even gets warm in just general everyday use.It's not going to burn you or set fire to your house but the constant heating/cooling cycles and the device running hot will not be great for component stability & therefore long-term viability of a >£400 phone. I decided to ditch it and get my money back before that could become my problem. As a chip design engineer myself, kind of amazed they are shipping regardless. Don't know what to go for now, most other recent Androids are enormous.

This defect is very subtle and only apparent when scrolling text on a white background, but once noticed is quite annoying.  I really wanted a smaller phone with a decent camera, so with the market not exactly flush with other possibilities I decided to keep the phone (albeit not perfect).

Amazon replaced in a week and so far, new one is working very wellFindings5.5"" LCD display - The display is nice and easy to read text and see pictures in most lights I only notice it’s a 720p when put up against a Quad HD equipped Phone.Responsiveness of Touchscreen - my old Xperia L you had to use your finger and it occasionally was slow to respond and wouldn't work with any stylus or gloves so I am pleased to report the new one is quick and accurate to use and works with stylus for better typing (my fingers are a little big for some of the keyboards that come up when online)Performance/Chipset - I was not expecting much as I have read MediaTek are a cheaper processor and graphic chip set as they did not perform so well but I have found this responsive in normal use and not bad in a few games I have tried.Battery life - The Battery is lasting mainly just around a day but Sony's software to improve the Battery’s performance has only just started to learn my usage patterns and has on Two occasions extended the battery to one and a half days so may improve. The battery is sealed in the phone so user can’t replace my Sony Xperia L had a removable one which means new L2 phone will have a shorter life.Fingerprint Sensor - this sensor is fast and easy to use and easy to set up and use making mobile banking and using the phone for shopping on line or in store more secure.Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat - This is fast and easy to use and doesn't have too much overlaid by Sony and little to no Bloatware some of Sony’s software apps are very good and easy to use I am not sure why but I got my Motorola Moto Z which had the Android 6 Marshmallow operating system(now on Android 8 Oreo) it allowed me to set up the SD Card as system memory (Friends Galaxy S7 edge does too)  which Sony doesn't  allow. Also must Question why Sony released the Xperia L2 in 2018 with 2016’s release 7.1.1 Nougat when all other phones were using 2017’s Android 8 Oreo and had no plans to upgrade the version of Android to 2017s Android 8 Oreo or 2018s 9 Pie ( I got 3 operating updates with my Nokia 700, Moto X and Moto Z and Motorola/Lenovo do one android update on competing Moto G range so not sure why Sony can’t do one Version update).Sound - Speaker not bad for a bottom Mid-range phone very good when using headphones.Camera - front and back cameras take nice pictures and are easy to use.Build Quality Plastic and glass feels solid easy to hold and looks good has big strips at the top and bottom of screen which dates it, but I like itSummary a Good Entry Model to Smart phones with good build quality (you will want a phone case to protect it) but you can get similar or better specked Samsung and Motorola as well as others with newer software and for less money.ProsScreen Good colours and good and easy to see in most lightsTouchscreen Responsive and arcuateSD Memory card Expansion3.5 headphone jack - Good Sound on Head phonesCamera takes good quality photosResponsive to use with little bloatwareSony provide a Software program for Windows and Mac OS to Back up and Restore phone such as texts Email and programs and transferring things from other phones Sony and other makes e.g. Apple or Samsung. I backed up the faulty Sony Xperia L2 and it restored the settings from that to the replacement I was very impressed as my company Samsung GS6 back up wouldn't load backup to new phone after original died.ConsOut of date version of Android installed when launched and No chance of Sony Updating to newer more secure version.Missing Wi-Fi ACSony Do Not allow SD card to be set to be used as System Memory like other Makes.Battery Life for a 3300mah Battery driving a low power 720p screen and low power chip-set I would expect 2-3 light days use not the 1-1.5 I am getting.Screen only 720p at this price point and slightly lower are using 1080p.Support If you get a hardware fault Sony's Repair company in Kent are the biggest Rip off Merchants going (Photograph every angle of phone possible before sending it to them).

The phone has surpassed all my expectations in every way.  I was using a z5 before and previous to my z5 I had a Z3 for 2 years. I will be comparing the XZ, z5/z3 and other phones I have used.Design The design has improved from the z3 and the z5, the phone feels solid and fits perfectly in your hand  , the metal back feels nice and solid, it is more durable than the glass back of the z3/ z5 and the corners are rounded too, making  it very comfortable in the hand. The screen has a rounded lip towards the edge, this is a nice touch and adds a degree of sophistication  to the design. There are enough design changes made to the XZ, that makes it look refreshing and different  from  the z5. It feels like a rolls Royce, solid and not light weight and flimsy like the Samsung s7 with its glass build.ScreenThe full 1080p 5.2 screen is sharp and vivid, the colours  are more natural and balanced than the over saturated colours of Samsung OLED screens. Comparing the Z5 and XZ the XZ brightness is  greater and the contrast is also better,  whites are more realistic than the z5. Having a full HD screen is an advantage because not only does it give you decent resolution it will put less stress on your processor, but will also preserve your battery life. This gives the ZX an advantage with phones with 2k screens.  Overall a very sharp glossy looking picture, it really stands out. I think Sony have coated their x series of phones screens with a glossy coating. The IPS panel  combined  with  the x reality pro engine ,which is used in there tvs , gives the XZ  one the best screens I've seen.PerformanceAs expected the Sony XZ is equipped with the latest snapdragon 820 chipset, with 3GB ram.The performance is rapid, smooth and without lag. The apps open instantly , browsers/ YouTube/casting/ and the camera instantly open. multitasking is excellent there is no lag. I would say it is about 15% faster than the previous snapdragon 810, Which my Z5 was equipped with. There is no overheating issues and the phone stays cool only getting slightly warm when gaming. When doing a side by side comparison with the z5, IE multi tasking, (app switching) the XZ was slightly faster  in every test i did, when compared with the z5. The z5 and XZ are very similar, in  day to day performance and there is not much  difference between them, and most people wouldn't notice , unless your were gaming.  Sony have the hardware and software tweaked very well.  The phone is equipped with 3gb ram, and it shows no lag, sony have optimized the phone really well,  Having 4/5 GB ram would only waste battery and  wouldn't make much difference to performance,  because android uses very little ram, the extra gig would be wasted. Sony take on android is clean with having very little bloatware. Its almost a stock android experience. One of the  new feature on this phone is  tip notifications, basically the phone learns your behaviour  and then trys to advise you by giving info on ""how to take better pictures"" etc. The Setup of the phone was so easy, basically I tapped my z5 and XZ together, all my goggle account, apps and contacts were ported over using NFC.  Overall the XZ performs  as good as any flagship from Samsung or htc, the big bonus is that the Sony  is cheaper than most flagships.Sound and CameraVoice calls are very clear , there is no distortion. Speakerphone is also clear  evan at loud volumes.The XZ supports hi res audio and LDAC Bluetooth compression. When streaming music to a wireless Bluetooth speaker, the sound quality is detailed  and clear with decent bass, LDAC seems to work and compression is kept to the minimum. The on-board stereo speakers are loud and clear , the stereo separation is done very well, the only negative point is that it does lack bass, but its a compromise  I can live with , due to the waterproofing of the speaker grills. Playing low quality MP3s are improved with DSEE HX UPSCALING and improves sound quality via audio jack or streaming or headphones. This is a accomplished music player. Camera quality has improved too , it has a new 23 megapixel sensor, what ever you throw at it you will see some of the best pictures a Smartphone can offer.  Not going to bore you with all the features and things this camera can do , but it is one impressive camera. Pictures are very detailed and  sharp, colours are natural, no oversaturation like I have seen on Samsung phones. The autofocus systems is fast you can take picture under a second without a blur.  This camera  is probably the best on the market. The Video quality is up there with the best, lots of detail  and real colours, i filmed a  1080p video of my 4 year old son playing in the park , the camera even picked up the individual whites stones in the tarmac. That's the sort detail were talking about.Battery life is about the same as my z5 just over a day and half , I like to way Sony have included a USB-C charging port, this will be the  standard soon and its good Sony have implemented the XZ with this, making it future proof, you can put the charging cable either way without breaking the usb port. I wish Sony had INCLUDED THE FAST CHARGER, They make you buy this separately.conclusionThe XZ is a accomplished phone it excels in all areas , everything is put together perfectly  in a single package , you have the best camera , best display, excellent build quality, waterproofing , Hi res audio . triple sensor camera, the list goes on. The XZ is also priced cheaper then all the current flagships. I would say if your looking for a quality waterproof android flagship, you wont be disappointed. If your upgrading  from a z3 or earlier, then this is a major improvement  and  worth going for. For Z5 owners i would say  its an improvement in the right areas  when comparing the z5 but not a massive one, if you happy with your z5 then  stick with it. if you can afford to upgrade to XZ then you will enjoy the new design and new features. The XZ is priced at £520 , not only is it cheaper then the S7 and apple iphone 7 but it offers all the specification, bell and whistle at lower price. Buy it with confidence and you wont go back.

Nice and slim but you might want to wack it in a case. (personal preference. A lot of people hate the Sony industrial look)- Fingerprint reader is snappy and makes life so much easier. I will never go back to a non fingerprint scanner phone.- OS has minimal bloatware. Whilst it does have some of the Sony apps on there it is not loaded with rubbish.- The Battery saver is sometimes annoying. occasionally it will not charge my phone in time for my wake up schedule. For the majority of time it is fairly intelligent and after a week or two of having the phone it understood my sleeping patterns well enough to be a minor nuisance. No idea if ti is a gimmick or not as I likely wont have the phone long enough to see if it actually extends the life of the battery!- Great screen. Hurts my eyeballs on max brightness and even having it set to 33% brightness I can forget that it is not on full- Sony quick with updates to the OSI have been a fan of Sony phones for a while. My last one was the Xperia Z1 that unfortunately went faulty. I purcahsed this for around £460 and it was worth the money. I think it will definitely hold up for a couple more years at least. With the recent launch of the ZX+ I believe the price will drop further making this a bargain!I cant comment on camera as I do not use it that much. Not had a problem running any apps and it does not seem to encounter the overheating issues that I have seen on the Z5 model.EDIT:Dec 2017 update.- Still going strong - SONY still smashing the updates to android - really great frequency of these.- Camera is not that great comapred to some of the phones out there now but still very good.- The battery saver now works perfectly and understand my routine - no problems with charging anymore.- Very rarely I do need a full reset to ""refresh"" the phone and make it feel like new again, perhaps once every 2 to 3 months. Apart from the occasional slowdown it is still very snappy and responsive.- no problems overheating

Those of you who always used Android are prolly gonna be fine though.I haven't used it much so far, but the call quality is decent enough. Music sounds fine when on a headset rather than the mono-speaker, and it works for the NHS app (sadly the Windows phone can't add any new apps coz of a lack of support resulting in this change for me) which is fine.Camera is pretty slick, if you like that sort of thing.

And i am so glad I did! Yes, the screen had a small scratch on one side, but was invisible when the screen was on, yes there was minor scuffs and wear and tear around the edge of the back cover but that will happen anyway, and no, it did not come with a manual or a charger but they are easy to buy. The functionality however, was perfect!I was very, very happy to have a more up to date phone, with an ace camera, fast download speeds, 5G , great picture quality, finger print sensor that actually works very well for security peace of mind, and able to download all the apps I need for banking, social media and entertainment viewing.Overall, A really happy customer.

I bought this to replace my aging Xperia XZ who's battery just wouldn't hold charge and the memory struggled to keep up.I'm not a busy on the go business user, or a young adult keeping up on all the socials, so I was looking for something that could do everything I needed at a reasonable price.Whilst this phone cost more than my old one it is an improvement in terms of memory, storage capacity and screen resolution. Having decent WiFi and network helps but browsing is quick and easy, the split screen feature is really useful for comparing prices etc on different sites for example.The only thing that really lets it down is the camera, it's not the greatest (even compared to my 4yr old one), and the start up and focusing will annoy you with how slow it is. It's not a deal breaker but Sony have always had great cameras on their phones I'm not sure what happened here!Anyway as a mid price entry level phone it looks great and feels very good in your hand, the slimmer profile and one handed use function are particularly good, that I'd recommend it for those not wanting hyper fast gaming, photography features.

I was totally bamboozled by the plethora of internet reviews about the "" best mid priced smartphone"" but had got it down to a choice of two. So I decided to keep to a strict budget. Therefore, based on the price, operating system, features and my simple usage I plumbed for this. The Oneplus Nord 2T.The phone promptly arrived and a lot of it's features, given good words by Amazon customers reviews, were proven to be very accurate.The operating system is Android 12 and the One plus UI overlay is pretty none intrusive over the general order of things. The battery lasted impressively considering the amount of use for installing, configuring and generally setting everything up. I would say I'm an average user and the battery lasted generally 2 days. I think this is good seeing as it is a modern phone and has a lot to do. Charging time was a remarkable step up but I'm of the "" make a brew whilst it's charging"" frame of mind so it's no biggie ( it is fast taking 0 to charged in roughly half an hour).The screen is very good indeed and has loads of settings that I'm still getting used to. The clarity of it struck me most - and contrary to what anyone says - 90Hz refresh rate is fab considering the size of the screen.The camera has loads of settings too but I'm very impressed with what I have seen so far.The phone itself comes with a case, screen protector already fitted and is a very sleek modern design. I opted to buy an extra cover and some tempered glass screen protectors as I know it may come across a set of keys in my pocket!! I particularly like the on screen finger print reader - as it actually works !! I took a tip from a previous reviewer and used my middle finger to set it up, due to cuts and knocks on my index finger and thumb.All in all I would say that if you would like a reasonably cheap phone ( by today's standards) with a load of neat features, dead easy to use, looks and feels great with a nifty bit of camera to boot - then you won't go far wrong with one of these. By the way - don't fuss over lack of IP rating - as you're not that daft to bury it in sand or go swimming with it - are you?!!

Do you need an ""overnight wireless charging""???The screen is one of the best on the market with variable refresh rate going down to 1 Hz and up to 120 Hz. It gets very bright and you don't have to worry even in the sunniest of days.The main camera is excellent for both day and night photos. The ultrawide camera is good for what it is i.e. it's the best the capabilities of it can give you- 8MP sensor (not exactly a compliment..); the 2MP macro camera is useless as usual...but the good news is the vast majority of people only use the main camera. The Selfie camera is good. No doubt about itIt's got stereo speakers that are very decent in terms of both loudness,clarity and even a little bit of bass.The IP rating is 65 which means full protection of dust and sprays of water from all sides. It ain't a rating to submerge your phone fully in water but it still is good enough for me. Maybe not you...The phone is made of glass front and back and an aluminium frame. Sturdy enough for sure and to last.And last but not least: it has a flagship chipset which:A) is surprisingly power-efficient and helps the batteryB) is blazingly fastC) is gonna last for at least 4 years from nowD) it's got everything needed - speed, reliability, efficiency, 5G, wi-fi 7,the whole shebang...

Had a look through everything and having had one plus flagship phones before thought I'd take a punt on this.Given this is a LCD screen it's very good, could be a bit brighter in full sun though, just enough to get by on a French beach though so ok. The one grumble is the adaptive brightness in dark rooms can be a little low, my other one plus phones suffered this too.Oxygen OS still feels as intuitive as ever and it is without question the best Android experience you can have still. So much of the unfinished feel has been taken away from android and if you're more used to Apple iOS you'll feel a bit more at home here.The camera needs a bit of getting used to but does take awesome shots of you use AI or go to the HD camera option. The AI is very good indeed and managed to pick out the colours and fill the Blanc's in on some very faded tapestries in french château making them look vibrant and lively. The camera detail however wipes the floor with the Samsung note 20 I had previously even if the software isn't as intuitive. It's worthwhile exploring a little more though, and 1+ do often improve camera stability through OTA updates.I chose the pastel lime green which a few people have now complimented on how stylish the phone looks. It's a better thought out than a other phones of this price and looks a bit iPhone inspired.What's missing from your usual one plus feel? The sound on off switch and the very high build quality. This is however a third of the price so you can't grumble really.Overall I'm happy I got this phone and it feels like excellent value. It's far better than most of the tech reviews indicate, and definitely better than the sum total of its parts would suggest.

Superb to use, no lag and very smooth.The handset is still 2020's large but it is both shorter and shallower than the A52 and easy to hold, I can even get it in a pocket.The face recognition is lightening quick, (be careful tho, security is compromised) and the OS is really slick... HOWEVER the OS in my honest view is not quite as smooth as Samsung's, it feels a bit pared back which i guess allows things to move much more quickly combined with a really strong processor so my mate at YouTube seems to say. I have to admit there are bits of the OS that just feel nicer with Samsung but comparing between the brands, this Oxygen OS thingy is just so very quick and like a Pixel so I am told.Fingerprint is miles better than the Samsung I had and I love having a physical switch to turn of notifications, I would have to recommend that you get a case and a screen protector as it will no doubt crack without one. Saying that the range of cases is not great, the Spigen one recommended was poor so I found a nice one from OnePlus themselves which fits perfectly and keeps things small but protected.Look its great, I really am impressed as i came into the Nord 2T with lower expectation but its such a nice phone with a really zippy OS and a great look and feel to the handset that I have to say this was a good move.Usually keep phones for 1 or 2 years so lets see how things go...

Rarely have to charge in the day.Cons -Some bugs which I'm sure OnePlus will fix, but they are quite annoying, for example, sometimes the phone cannot pick up any 4g/5g data,  you have to manually turn off the data and back on.  Also when in a low light environment the selfie cam seems to always default to light up the screen mode, even if you turn it off.  Also sometimes the bluetooth disconnects from my car and needs manually reconnecting.Not major issues but hopefully they are ironed out as it's a fantastic phone.

I haven't ever bought this brand before (not heard of it tbh) until I checked the top mid price android phones on tech radar. I love its size, light weight, easy set up, intuitive features, responsive finger print. It's really a diamond of a phone, came with a free silicone case as well. Flaws? Well there is no headphone jack at all and the battery needs a charge every day. But I can live with that!

I paid £299 for the 8GB / 128GB version. I wouldn't pay more for the 12 / 256 as the 8GB is plenty fast.Almost flagship quick processor. A good camera for the price, although I'm comparing it to a pixel 4 where the camera is exceptional, so a little unfair. Good all day battery life and mega quick recharging - 0 to 100% in 30 mins, but you have to use the included charger AND the cable. Colour is grey but with a blue tinge, maybe this is what Sierra means....Screen is lovely to use....don't use the Samsung internet browser, as this isn't compatible with a smooth 90HZ refresh rate that this phone has.Fast and responsive 2D face recognition and fingerprint reader.The glass back feels more like plastic, but I still like it. Overall the phone is stylish and in my opinion looks better than the mid range product it is.Screen brightness could be better in direct sunlight but it's perfectly useable......No IP rating, but it does have OIS on the camera. And a bit heavier than I would like.But if you're as geeky as I am you probably already know these things!Comparing this to my ageing ""top spec at the time"" Pixel 4, I'm impressed and prepared to miss out on the features I really want for this price.

I then started to look at their phones and research OxygenOS and liked what I saw.I then discovered the Nord series - midrange handsets with near flagship level features/specs and started investing more time into it. I found out the latest Nord model would release. So after weeks of mulling it over and directly comparing the P30 against the Nord 2 I decided to take the plunge.I took delivery of the phone the next day and set about unboxing and setting it up. I was like a kid at Christmas. The phone came in a nice looking black box with simple blue lines down the side and the OnePlus Nord branding imprinted on the front. When you shine light on the Nord lettering and look from a certain angle you can see a multi-colour reflection.I then unboxed the phone which came with a screen protector preinstalled and a clear rubber case (when you set the phone down on a flat surface with the case on and turn on the torch the entire thing lights up around the edges and looks pretty snazzy) Also included is the 65w charger, red USB-C cable, SIM removal tool, documents and a very nice letter from OnePlus.Holding the phone in my hand without the case, I have to say it feels amazing, it's a really comfy phone to hold and unlike any phone I've held before, because of the materials it's made from. It's kind of hard to explain but it just feels nice in the hand. It's almost like a silky smooth texture with very slight roughness for grip.Anyway, I powered on and set up the phone, logged in with my Google details, ran all the system software updates and installed all my apps. I then went to settings to do some tinkering and customise the OS to a look and feel of my liking. Everything is easy to find in the settings and there's a respectable amount of things to customise for the OS (colours, AOD, fonts, wallpapers, horizon light for notifications etc)As for OxygenOS itself I like it - very fresh, clean and simple. And it'll only get better once 12.0 releases. It's currently 4 April 2022 as I'm writing this and I'm still waiting for 12.0 so hopefully it'll be here soon. A Theme store and more new features will be getting added, as far as I'm aware. Just search OxygenOS 12 to see the new additions.The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset is as good as any on-par Qualcomm Snapdragon and can handle graphic intensive games like COD Mobile with ease - No overheating. No lag. Nothing of the sort that I've noticed. The MediaTek is a solid performing chipset and the glue that holds everything together. Great levels of performance with no noticeable frame drops or dips during gameplay or in general daily usage.As for the refresh rate the Nord 2 might only have 90Hz capability and not the 120Hz of some flagship models but it's obviously better than 60Hz and is pretty much the sweet spot, as battery life would suffer under 120Hz. You can have it in either 90Hz or 60Hz mode but sometimes the phone will switch between modes depending on the scenario. I leave it on 90Hz for the most part and it's fine.The FHD+ Fluid AMOLED display with HDR10+ makes for impressive viewing - sharp looking details, vibrant & true to life colours which pop nicely (you can change vividness in settings) and overall just a nice, big, bright, crystal clear viewing experience - games, TV series, movies and YouTube all look amazing!The 4500mAh battery with 65w charging is a godsend and will get you out of a jam, for example if you're short on time. I've put the Nord 2 on charge at around 15%, gone away then come back about 25 minutes later and it's already at 100%. They weren't lying about the charging speed.Awesome camera, too! Shots with the built-in Sony IMX766 Exmor sensor look sharp with nice accurate colour and detail, however some shots do look washed out. Night shots look decent but not the best and can look overprocessed and grainy due to the AI scene recongition mode. I'll admit I've been spoiled by the P30's Leica AG camera though (one of the best smartphone cameras ever produced) so the experience might be different for you depending on what phone you're coming from.As for Audio, I do miss the baked in DolbyAtmos audio from the P30 which gave rich, detailed and crystal clear sound across the board with several scenario based modes to choose from, despite only having the one loudspeaker. The Nord 2 has arguably worse audio on balance but it does have the benefit of two loudspeakers which does claw back some of that loss.All in all, there is more than enough with the Nord 2 to warrant it as a truly worthy near-flagship upgrade from whichever device you're using now, like me with the P30 for example (I know, the standard P30 isn't a flagship)Nord 2 is a very capable device and has something for everyone with its impressive spec sheet and range of apps and features. I've had the 8GB RAM model for 7 months now and its still hitting the high notes like the day I got it. I can imagine the 12GB RAM variant is basically Nord 2 on roids. I fully recommend you to get this phone, you won't be sorry!Thanks for taking the time to read this. I might come back with edits from time to time.

For a mid range phone it is priced very well. The Oxygen OS is slick, customizable and easy to use. The phone itself (8GB Ram) is plenty fast enough for most users. Fingerprint is fast, facial recognition is fast, charging is genuinely fast. Like silly fast. Like you almost feel bad how fast it charges.However, the phone does have some drawbacks. The main camera (50mp) is good, don't get me wrong. But, it does come with some flaws. The 50mp lens is just that. No optical (this is advertised) but it also cannot digital zoom. You cannot change any settings (AI etc) on the 50mp lens, just focus/Auto focus. It does take good pictures but it will not be the default when you open up the camera app. If you're in a rush trying to take a picture of something, you will have to manually change it to the 50mp lens every time you open the camera app (unless you keep it open constantly in the background). So you are stuck with the 8mp digital zoom lens which is okay but I want my 50mp lens to atleast have a digital zoom.Coming from a OnePlus 6 with notification LED, I really did not realize how good a feature that LED is. I miss it a ridiculous amount which is hilarious and saddening at the same time. Downloaded an app for the always on display to mimic but it just isn't the same and does drain battery.Overall, a really good phone. More phone than most people need these days. It isn't a ""flagship killer"" but it definitely is worth the money, especially when there is an offer on.And also as an FYI, the phone does come with its own clear OnePlus case (actually a decent case, see myself using it until it's properly worn out) in the box which isn't advertised. Would be nice to know this before ordering a seperate case to just end up returning after opening the box.

It has an amazing battery life, screen, responsiveness and charging speeds that still amaze me.Being able to charge my phone at an absurd rate to 100% and then also getting at least six hours of screen on use despite the most suboptimal scenario (5g, High refresh rate and display settings maxed) is a game changer and quickly dispels any concerns about the lack of wireless charging.I can't fault the phone for it's beefed up and tactile vibration feedback, sound quality and display quality. But now for the downsides.The software is snappy out of the box but then does feel a little clunky or unresponsiveness randomly. This, I believe, is down to how the phone starts to learn which apps you use frequently, which ones it needs to not keep in memory and general system optimisations.Remedying this is simple enough, do some research into settings to turn off like ram boost, animation timing and other things to keep it feeling snappy.Comign from an older oxygen os version I feel they have lost a lot of the efficiency. So much so that there isn't a huge amount of responsiveness difference between this and my old one plus 7 pro. I however, welcome the amazing battery life that the 8 gen 2 offers and yes it will handle pretty much everything without slow down.For longevity I went with the larger ram and storage version. Just because 12 gb of ram is ideal to keep pretty much any reasonable amount of apps in memory (no power user can really multitask that much on a phone).The other major major downside is how uneasy you feel holding this phone without a case. Soemthing about the ergonomics and glass back make this so slippery. Just resting in your hand it slips, I had to scavenge some grip tape for the few days I didn't have a case just because of this.So definitely get a case and that's then completely resolved.Cameras. Another one that one plus haven't made huge leaps in. They've instead delegated much of the quality to in built filters and ai processing. Which maybe fine but the raw ability of the camera has to stand alone to produce reliably good, share worthy images. Something that they actually had done really well on op7.The overall verdict. It's a buy at this price and represents unbeatable value without compromise. Overall I am very happy with it. It's short comings for me could be fixed is subsequent software updates. But as we all know we can't rely on one plus to deliver efficiencies but thank fully can rely on them to support android updates - however well or badly they are implemented.

Battery also has not been as good as expected and I feel it is degraded over time.------------------------------------------I just had to share my thoughts on this amazing phone! First off, the battery life is just mind-blowing. I can go through my entire day without worrying about charging it constantly. It's a game-changer for sure!I've heard some people comparing it to Color OS, but honestly, it's Oxygen OS and is packed with awesome features. The split-screen functionality using the side bar is just so intuitive and easy to use, much like Samsung's One UI.It doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy S23 Ultra does! Why pay more when the OnePlus 11 offers almost everything you need at a fraction of the cost?Also with a promise of 4 years of updates, OnePlus has really won me over. It's even longer than what Google Pixel offers, and that's saying something (if you ever keep the phone for 4 years!)There's no wireless charging or IP68 rating, but that's not a big deal for me. The 100W charging (UK) is insanely fast, so I never worry about running out of juice. As for the IP68 rating, who really takes their phone fully submerged?!All in all, the OnePlus 11 has been an absolute delight to use. It ticks all the right boxes for me - long-lasting battery, impressive OS features, and a reliable camera. Plus, it saves me some serious money compared to other flagship phones. It's definitely a choice you won't regret.

The battery life on this phone is very, very good and the charging speed is even better. As such this thing is hardly ever on charge.That's mainly due to the processor. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is very fast but more importantly very efficient - moreso than Android flagship processors have been in a few years. Combine that with the UFS 4.0 storage (on the 256GB model), 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a commitment to update four versions of Android (up to Android 17) and five years of security updates, and this phone should be good for the next five years. If you want a phone to match the longevity of an iPhone, this is it.The build quality is up there with an iPhone or Samsung too. The fit and finish is immaculate and you can tell it is made out of high-quality materials. It feels solid and cold to the touch and has a fair bit of weight to it, although it's not too heavy like the latest iPhone 14 Pro Max. The circular camera sets the phone apart and as ever the Alert Slider is very useful (and should be included on all phones).I also find the software to be a pleasure to use. I have read so many comments and reviews bemoaning the move away from the old Oxygen OS to the new version based on Color OS, and there have been some teething issues in the transition, but now it's stable and mature. It's a great version of Android with more customisation options than before.Finally, I have been blown away by the camera. Having used Google Pixel's for smartphone photography for a while, I can happily say the Oneplus 11 is right up there with the Pixel 7. Oneplus uses Hasselblad colour science which is very much on the warm and saturated side of things. It's an acquired taste and differs wildly from the Pixel's cooler tones but I love the look of the photos. When zooming in on my monitor, side by side, I can see more detail in the Oneplus photos. This carries over to the wide angle lenses too, where the Oneplus packs in more detail and matches the colour science of the main lens.There are three main gripes I have with the Oneplus 11. There first is the telephoto lens only being 2x. It's useful for portraits, and it actually surprised me with how much detail is provides all the way up to 4x, but it's not in the same league as the periscope telephotos on the Pixel 7 Pro and S23 Ultra. At £800 I would have expected better. I would also have expected wireless charging and an IP68 water resistance rating, but neither of those are present. To be fair, I would never use wireless charging anyway given how rapid the 100 watt wired charging (which they include in the box by the way) is here but it would have been nice to have the option.In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Oneplus 11. I think it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the iPhone 14 Pro, the S23+ and the Pixel 7 Pro and I can't see anyone being disappointed in it.

The camera is fantastic and has several modes in which the camera takes fantastic HD and amazing quality pictures. The battery lasts near enough a day and a half on 100% charge. The phone is extremely fast and responsive to opening applications as well as closing them and modifying them. The screen is brilliant and the notch at the top is hardly noticeable when browsing and or watching viedos. The OS is a joy and is simple to use. The face recognition toke me by absolute surprise on how accurate and fast it works.Overall I would say for a burdget £300-450 range phone it is worth the money by far.My only criticism would be the lack of upgrading storage and or no audio port. But looking into the market of smartphones this seems to be a trend with most phone manufacturers. Bummer.If you are hesitant on getting this phone. I would say get it, you won't regret it!!! :)

For One plus X I paid 180£ and that was the best phone I ever had. Very best quality for small price, for 6T I spent about 500£ and this is quite a lot of money. Don't get me wrong, this is good phone for this price and still better than mentioned before samungs and Iphones, however price jump quite quickly so hopefully you won't have to pay same money like for samsung in futures versions of One Plus

Plenty of memory and storage. Has face ID and fingerprint scan as well, the latest Apple dropped on their latest phones but i think it is extremely useful. I find the latest Android op system quite fascinating and responsive, Google assistant seems to be more responsive and detailed recently than Siri... It hasn't got a wireless charging feature, but that does not seem to bother me at all. It is half the price of the latest Apple device with same specs, so for me defo this one did the trick. Well done One Plus!!!!

I've been through a month long saga trying to find the perfect phone for me (OnePlus, Xiaomi, Samsung) and this is the one!tbh I have no idea what some of the people are talking about in regards to the OS, everything feels super snappy. I debloated both the OnePlus 11 and Xiaomi 13T using UAD and the Xiaomi had far more bloatware on it, not to mention that oxygen OS is much nicer in everyday use than miui (and I always use a third party launcher so I could care less anyway tbh). The Xiaomi 13T supposedly has a similar processor but trust me it doesn't feel that way in practice. Something about that phone just felt ""off"".Battery life is excellent and if you optimise some settings you can get even more. I charged my phone to 60% whilst transferring some files and I've since had 6 hours screen on time (15% battery remaining). In comparison the Xiaomi would give me 8 hours from full charge with even more settings turned off. The charging is also super quick, like 0 > 100% in 25 mins. It doesn't even heat up as much as the Xiaomi did and that was only charging at 67W. Take into account that this is also day one of me using the phone so it hasn't even adjusted to my usage yet. So yeah if you are looking for good battery life in a mid tier phone then this is a solid choice, the only one that was better in that regard that I tested was the Nord 3 but I had more issues with that phone (including low wireless earbud volume, which I'm happy to say this one does not - Dolby Atmos sounds excellent).The phone should be getting android 14 in December or January and will get OS updates to android 17, with security updates to 2028 (by which point you probably want to buy a new phone anyway 😅).Display looks great even at the slightly lower resolution setting and I haven't noticed the auto brightness issues that reviewers & users on Reddit mentioned. Also although the screen is curved I wouldn't let it put you off as it's barely noticeable once you have a case on it.I won't mention too much about the camera quality because it's not what I use my phone for but it's perfectly acceptable IMO, and if you get the right case then the big camera Island doesn't protrude at all.TLDR; If you are a general person like me using socials, music, YouTube etc then I think you will be pleased.At this current price I don't think you are likely to find a better value phone.

Everything about the hardware (screen, speed, responsiveness, battery life, cameras etc.) is excellent. The 100W charging is insanely fast. Reviews mark it down for not having wireless charging but, when it goes from 10% to 90% in 20 mins, who needs that. It would get 5 stars but for two things.1. Although apparently in the hardware, there is no access to VoLTE (4G mobile calling) in the system settings/software. As the 3G network is being switched off in the UK this a major shortcoming and is unbelievable in a 2023 flagship phone. I did the obvious tests of swapping SIM cards and phone brands to confirm that SIMs which work with VoLTE in other phones don't work in the OnePlus.2. Customer service is as useful as a chocolate teapot! When contacted about the above (both email and phone) they have come up with nothing better than the equivalent of 'switch it off and on again', which does nothing. After weeks of requests to be put through to someone with proper knowledge of the OS I'm still waiting. I went through the same process with exactly this issue on my previous OnePlus 7T before finally getting through to someone in the technical team who eventually had to admit that it wasn't possible to access the VoLTE switch in the system software. His parting comment in defeat was that ""OnePlus are losing the plot"". I had hoped that they would have got their act together by now, but it seems they haven't. BTW, searching online forums it seems that VoLTE is enabled in the Indian market but not elsewhere, which makes the situation even more maddening.

My first OnePlus was a 7Pro which I had from launch day and really loved it, awesome phone. I waited 2.5 years to upgrade to a 9Pro and really pleased with it too. The screen on the 7Pro was awesome, but the 9Pro is even better with super dark blacks and really crisp. I held off on the Android 12 upgrade until the latest C44 upgrade and I've had zero issues with that too. The phones performance is awesome, nothing stutters or lags, great screen, great camera, 65W charging is crazy quick... I don't like charging to 100% to protect the battery life and it charges so quickly most time it's at 100% before I realise, having only left it for 20 mins or so! The irony also is battery life is less of a concern because it charges so quickly, but I get 2-3 days between charges so it's not an issue for me, but I don't game or watch video on the phone so my screen on time is pretty low in comparison to those use cases.The only area of concern for me was the camera bulge but I bought lens protectors for the glass and a protector which fits around the bulge (ie flattens out the gaps between the lenses) and I'm happier now about not scratching/ damaging the lens glass. Oh, and maybe the green colour isn't the best compared to the blue of the 7Pro, but nothing a different case can't fix!OK so I did pick the 265GB version up at a great price (under £700) so maybe those who paid over £900 feel aggrieved, and maybe I've been lucky waiting as hardware / software / OS updates have been largely ironed out.For the right price it's an awesome phone IMHO. I was looking at an S21 Ultra 255GB but at almost half the price the 9Pro is no way half the phone.... All it lacks is the S21s super zoom, everything else is the same as far as I can tell...  So, after just over 2 months of daily use I'm super pleased with my OnePlus 9Pro.

That should be fixed with Android 12!","All-round brilliant experience!The battery -  lasts a very good amount of time, for a phone with such a great screen, it lasts above 5 hours of continuous use with 120hz and 1080p. I found the battery going from 95-1% in 5 hours of screen time and 16 hours uptime.The cameras - are really good, a bit lacklustre in some departments but honestly can be easily fixed with software tuning. The Hasselblad Collab brings an interesting choice of colouring that makes for a sometimes odd-looking image but in good lighting this camera is Grade A! Not to mention the night mode and low light pictures are phenomenal. However again I think a software update would be needed for video performance in low light.The screen - is one of, if not, the BEST screen on any phone right now! It rivals the S21 Ultra! It's bright, clear and filled with great colouring. Watching IMAX Disney Plus films in 1440 mode and 120hz is a magnificent experience.Not to mention, the speakers are very very good and deliver good surround sound in landscape mode!As for the overall software experience - it's classic OnePlus and they do deliver on that simple but customisable experience. Come Android 12 and OxygenOS 12 (OnePlus' Software) we are going to need to see some fine-tuning. As for when that happens? This phone will most likely be a no brainer, a brilliant phone and I hope to return to say all polished. There really isn't much to improve it's just minor bugs and inconsistencies (such as a sometimes inconsistent Bluetooth experience, I've seen devices a year old+ perform difficulty but a brand new set of earbuds work fine! Connectivity is the only real issue).An all-around brilliant phone experience, ESPECIALLY for the price, and soon I'm sure to be an excellent experience!If you can grab this device cheaper than launch price when the 10 series release, then do by any means possible!8.5/10 phone when compared to the high-end flagships, with the potential to be 10/10!

Battery life is mediocre, even if you don't use the phone for gaming. Switch Bluetooth or location on and you wont make it half a day on a full charge. Sometimes it overheats without even using it. Then I am forced to turn it off and leave it off for a few minutes.Oneplus should introduce at least 500gb of internal storage for a phone which costs this much. If you take photos on a daily basis, you definitely need more storage.Yes you can use google backup services etc, but why should I pay extra cash for storage when I paid so much for a premium phone?I guess nothing good last forever, right Oneplus?

Showcasing a catalogue of awe-inspiring features, this phone doesn't just meet expectations—it surpasses them.The first thing that strikes you about the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is its blazing-fast performance. Multitasking and app usage are seamless experiences, reinforcing the device's superiority. Its multimedia capabilities don't disappoint either—with brilliant picture quality and immersive sound, it’s tailor-made for a top-tier media consumption experience.OnePlus's collaboration with the esteemed camera company, Hasselblad, has culminated in a unique Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. This partnership has accelerated innovation in mobile photography, featuring natural color calibration. The potent combination of a primary 48 MP camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a telephoto lens, and a monochrome camera guarantees breathtaking photos. This impressive camera suite shines even in challenging, low-light conditions.But the delights of the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G are not confined to photography. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch Smart 120Hz AMOLED display, enriched with LTPO technology, delivering a fluid and vivid viewing experience. Remarkably, the display achieves a 120Hz refresh rate while consuming up to 50% less power—an undeniable testament to its superior engineering.The innovative Warp Charge technology is another standout feature. Equipped with a 4500 mAh battery, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G exhibits astonishing charging speeds—jumping from 1% to 70% in a mere 30 minutes with Warp Charge 65T. Not to be outdone, the wireless charging capability is equally fast, promising a full day's worth of power in just 15 minutes.Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform, delivering a 25% boost in overall performance over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 865. It operates on OxygenOS 11, known for its clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.However, perfection is elusive, and the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is not exempt from minor shortcomings. Users have reported occasional bugs and issues with the Oxygen OS, although these are likely to be addressed in forthcoming updates. The placement of the fingerprint sensor could also be optimized for greater accessibility.Pros:  • Extraordinary camera performance due to Hasselblad partnership.  • Fluid and vibrant display enabled by LTPO technology.  • Incredible charging speed, courtesy of Warp Charge 65T and wireless charging.  • High-octane performance powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform.  • Aesthetically pleasing design and excellent build quality.Cons:  • Potential bugs and issues with Oxygen OS.  • The fingerprint sensor's placement could be improved for easier access.In conclusion, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G represents the apex of smartphone technology, offering an extraordinary camera experience, unparalleled performance, and a breathtaking display. A few minor flaws aside, this phone is a compelling contender for anyone seeking a flagship device with state-of-the-art features. It delivers on its promises, making it a worthy addition to the top tier of the smartphone market.

True flagship experience. Getting all of the flagship features that have been missing in previous generations. Picked up on discount for £ 620. While the 9 Pro is a lot more expensive than OnePlus's previous devices (especially at RRP). It's great value when picked up on sale as it's close to being as good as a S21 Ultra while undercutting it by over £ 300 even when that phone was on its best discount too. OnePlus phones are on sale more often now since the brands popularity has grown and the phone is now available at multiple retailers in the UK. Back in OnePlus 6 days the phone was almost never on sale so even though the devices are more expensive now, you can still pick them up for around £ 450-650 when on heavy discount half a year later. (Especially for non Pro model). At these discounted prices I feel like they might even offer more value then the previous OnePlus phones did at the £ 500 RRP. I've listed some of the main pros and cons that I've experienced below.Pros:- Amazing bright & smooth screen- Great performance- Clean software- Elegant design, Stellar Black colour looks super stealth- Very good rear cameras especially ultra wide. No fish eye effect. Good detail and dynamic range. Video in artificial light surprisingly good also even at high resolution & high framerates due to large camera sensor.- 8k video good for future proofing. But I think 4k video is a lot more consistent and what should be used instead.- Loud and clear stereo speakers.- High quality vibration motor adds better haptic feedback. Both this and the stereo speakers are massive upgrades from older OnePlus devices.- Great that the phone still comes with a charging brick in the box. Very Fast wired and wireless charging. I timed a 5%-100 wired charge in 27minutes. This changes the way you use a phone. Such a great feature!Cons:- Fingerprint sensor placement isn't the best. Would prefer it to be a bit higher up on the screen.- Speed and reliability of indisplay fingerprint sensor Isn't as good as rear mounted OnePlus 6 one. Still very quick and good especially for indisplay sensor. Surprised how good these are. Minor con.- Front camera not as high end as competitors.- Battery life is an A- not A+. I get around 6-7 hours screen on time running phone at 1440p 120Hz. This depends on your usage habits so can vary for different users.

Avoid!","Original review below for comparison. Good hardware still needs good software and in this regard Oneplus have failed with their android 12 roll out. After 3 beta tests the stable release broke some essential features (like mobile signal...) And removed some existing ones (One plus have now withdrawn the update for further work). If you need a new phone get a pixel 6 or an S21 instead.Old review:Good things (coming from an s20 ultra)-Latest Snapdragon chip-The matte finish on the back is better than shiny glass.-Fingerprint reader is very fast and much more accurate than my last phone.-Oxygen OS is close enough to stock android to use as is (sooo much better than One UI).-Supplied wired charger is superfast!-Camera is pretty good so far. I prefer not having super saturated photos as I did with the s20 ultra.-Comes with a case-Battery life is good, the phone lasts me the day.-Cheaper than a Samsung-The whole throttling thing-Despite that it can get quite hot under heavy load.-One+ are apparently merging oxygen OS with Colour OS and future updates will be based on that.-Not much clarity on the number of OS updates for the device (Samsung are actually good at this now, how things change).-No SD card slot or headphone jack.I guess I'm happy enough. I think the days of new phones surprising with design or new features are long gone. This is a good device with a few drawbacks that will nonetheless do very well for most people at a slightly lower pricepoint than its competitors.

If like me you are in regular meetings etc, it's a simple, but super handy feature.The super fast 80w charging is amazing too, can plug it in, make a cuppa, go back to the phone and it's gained 20%+.  I didn't think this would matter, but have found giving it a quick battery top up now and then, make me forget about plugging it in overnight.  That said, if charging overnight, it automatically trickle charges.Watch some video reviews, there are more features, but I can honestly not fault this phone, I cannot see any difference in functionality compared to big brand names.

It’s fast, smooth, reliable to name a few things. The processor is a flagship from a couple years back but holds up so well, ray tracing capabilities, flies through apps and games, well worth it alone just for that. The Nord 3 is essentially the flagship of the series, with 16GB LPDDR5X RAM (the fastest available), and 256GB UFS 3.1 storage, it’s well worth the price. The screen is a gorgeous 6.7 inch, 1.5k, 120hz fluid AMOLED display. Unlike most other midrange phones too, there is almost no bezel, and the bezel that is there is even all the way around. The cameras are decent too, not flagship tier despite the main sensor being the same found in the oneplus 11, but it’s exceeded my expectations for a midrange device like this. Honestly don’t waste your money on something stupidly expensive, the Nord 3 is one of the most flagship tier midrangers I’ve ever used.

And let me say, the display is absolutely stunning, sharp, beautiful colour production, amazingly smooth 120hz refresh rate that is immediately noticeable, and the screen also has software accelerated motion smoothing which further adds to the silky smooth video production.I purchased the 128gb 8gb version and the phone is actually extremely fast, sometimes it takes me by surprise!! Runs some more visually demanding games buttery smooth.The phone itself feels premium quality in the hand and the back is a thing of beauty, especially in the colour morning mist. The camera lenses are large and look really pleasing to the eye.Battery life is 4/5 BUT, This is a big BUT.. You have no idea how fast this phone charges. 30 mins to 100% and it's not spec sheet lies. It really does charge faster than anything I've ever witnessed! Amazing for people who use their phone a lot and wish to charge for a little bit after heavy use, 10 mins will easily charge to 30%Moving to the camera itself, if you are unfamiliar with Hassleblad whom collaborated with OnePlus to create the camera system create very high end medium format cameras. As a photographer with 20 years experience I definitely have a valid opinion of it's performance, the cameras are really great in well lit situations, with great colour reproduction, sharp images with great clarity. Low light is harder to get a sharp image but that can be corrected with a little tripod.My only gripe would probably be the shutter time, I've had phone's that are faster but as a landscape photographer this isn't a problem.The selfie camera is good and produces a bookah effect, although it's software produced, this is still not good enough to retire your DSLR!The operating system is android obviously but the oxygen OS mod that oneplus produced is by far my favorite, it's easy to use, plenty of customisation options and definitely has a one up on samsung.Overall, I'm still in shock at the price for such a phone.. have they messed up the pricing? Aha.Want my opinion? Just buy it, I'm literally over the moon with it.Hope this helped you decide.My apologies if I missed anything out.

In just 10-20 mins of charging, the phones battery will go from 5% (in my example) to 50% plus easily. For peace-of-mind alone, it's one of the features I love the most.The 90Hz refresh rate on the screen is also fantastic, and really doesn't dent the battery life all that much. I'm not a heavy user, but do spend a lot of time on Twitter and Reddit when commuting to and from work.I came from a Pixel 2 XL, which was having an issue with it's battery charging port, which was driving me nuts, especially as I am very forgetful when it comes to remembering to charge the thing. I had to hold the charger in the port and keep pressure on it just to charge.Camera wise, it's not as good as the Pixel, but to honest, you'd have to look pretty close to see a huge difference. The front camera pops up for selfies (if that's your thing) as well as for facial recognition. I tested dropping the phone on to my sofa with the camera out, and it will instantly go back in if it senses that the phone is falling, which is a great little feature.Price wise, it really is value for money, as you will be paying a lot more for the features that this device has when compared to other flagship devices. The OLED screen also look incredible compared to my previous Pixel XL 2.

Best decision EVER,"I have had iphones on contracts for 10 years. I also have a Mac as my only computer, so was reluctant to try anything else.However, I decided that I needed to break away from the contract loop, and buy a phone outright to use with a sim only deal.  This phone blew away the competition at the same pricepoint.I LOVED my iPhones.  My last one was the iphone 8, which was coming up to 2 years old.  This phone absolutely destroys it in every way.The screen!  OMG - no cut outs, no notches, just fills the entire face of the phone with 90htz, OLED goodness.  Seriously this is the greatest screen ever fitted to a mobile phone.The speed!  It charges SO fast! If I'm going out and my phone is on 15%, I can plug it in while I get ready.  20 minutes later it's at 80+%!  Every task you do on the phone is SO FAST! it makes my iphone look like a toy.The battery - I use it in a morning before work, as a sat nav for an hour, on and off during my 8 hour day at work, and as a sat nav on the way home again.  It's never dropped below 55% by the time I get home.  My iphone would have needed a good charge half way through the dayOxygen - The optimisations that Oneplus have put into this phone are incredible.  It's Stock Android, only better!Compared to the Apple experience.  OK - it doesn't natively play nicely with a Mac.  But I can now do everything that I did with my iPhone, plus a whole lot more.  A bit of research gave me a great mail app, a great messaging app (that I can also use from my Mac), screen mirroring and phone control from my Mac etc etc.  In short it's not as 'plug and play' as using an iphone within apple's ecosystem - but everything is possible.Seriously if you are considering this phone, just buy it - it is completely and utterly fantastic.  The best phone I have ever seen or used, by some margin.

It's been about a month now and I'll have to say, OnePlus may have a new fan.Started off on the Samsung band wagon, when the Note 2 was the biggest phone you could get, I loved the screen size. Tried almost every phone you can think of, I even had an iPhone 6s Plus until this OnePlus came along. Currently wrapping up the iPhone to sell.Pros- Stupid fast!- Silky smooth- Futuristic look- Nice customizable UI- Well pricedCons- Battery with 90hz and 2k hits the battery a bit. I still get home with about 70% and then play games, scroll social media, watch YouTube for about 4 hours then the battery goes down to about 30%Now that's pretty good, but I had a Huawei Mate 20 Pro and that phone had ridiculously good battery life.The good thing is you can turn off 90hz and 2k and you'll have superb battery life but thats not fun- lack of premium phone cases... Like really, where the good looking wood and leather cases at?- I've slightly missed wireless charging, not enough to stop using the phone, but occasionally I find myself wanting to just put the phone on a charging pad.

OnePlus,"OnePlus 8T 5G 8GB RAM 128GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with Quad Camera, 65W Warp Charge and Dual SIM - Lunar Silver - 2 Year Warranty",370,https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-8T-5G-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Lunar-Silver/dp/B08HJLLFZC/ref=sr_1_31?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eBBZsPdqPIeTqv0XxDug9gVTc585yw_Ug5kMEdGewK4fvMi4GkuVaq9L4g8NHipz5XoJi1X4m_qDjfwY876QWxy0E0Me-Mz6iwiPGXNjaNwbDiW7yTlfuImEpvXASFNJjBxIyeyVX-o1YjM3_VmIy3-41ztxqn3gVfyWKyt-qe_EXvsXix-L4VxQaB3PXvVkGOOw8feWiKX93-4cMAEvdsznRXoHxnaUOBNTqHzynC4NHf8HTRUeAd45lQw5htLgfJpjuOrq98kQYMfvGYsdm1A-Jp0RVmg6v4ZzBs1cnAI.3-KBJc3vhD6_OabLPM1UJrUNOhKF1JaM_cMObIkQ44w&dib_tag=se&qid=1714768831&refinements=p_89%3AOnePlus&rnid=1632651031&s=telephone&sr=1-31,"Great phone, Great price","For £400 (or less with warehouse) it is phenomenal value... only the poco f3/X3 can really compare in terms of value. As I mentioned earlier, if you can find it significantly cheaper with amazon warehouse, it's great. I saved a bunch, and when I slapped a case on it, you can't see any of the physical imperfections caused from that. When it came missing its case and sim ejector tool, I was really pleased with the refund I got to cover the costs of them separately. You get everything that much more expensive phones have; 120hz AMOLED display, great build quality, (somewhat) decent cameras and video, various unlocking techniques (although my face id works when I have a tighter mask on sometimes - so uh, yeah), super fast (last gen) flagship processor, and excellent charging capabilities included in the box *cough* Apple and Samsung *cough*.The charging speed and battery capacity is really great (don't care about wireless charging), it does get a little warm to the touch after charging at 65W for a little bit, so if you are charging it overnight, I recommend using a slower charger if you have one just to keep the battery cool when charging to help lengthen battery life. So if anything, the charging is TOO fast, but it's is amazing if I need to charge it for like 5 minutes if I'm low. The OS is clean and snappy, fingerprint and face-id are fast, and the sd 865, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage powering it all is really really fast. The speakers are actually quite good, and 5G support is always appreciated, never connected to it, but still cool. I also just want to mention the alerts slider, my favourite non-standard part of the phone imo, If I'm going somewhere where a notification sound is not ideal, I can switch it to vibrate or silent while it's still in my pocket.The cons; the screen is great with that 120hz smoothness, the contrast and colours are amazing, and the front camera is nicely out of the way in the corner. I'd like to say I noticed a massive difference between 60 and 120hz, but I didn't, there's a difference in things like scrolling, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker if you want to save money on a cheaper phone; I did notice that my old phone felt slower than I remember though, so maybe don't go the other way if you've experienced 120Hz before. However, when in settings (on dark mode obviously) you definitely notice some smearing when the pixels have to transition from off (black) to on. This is not exclusive to this phone though, a friend of mine has a pixel where it also happens, it is an OLED problem as far as I know. And unfortunately I don't think the screen gets bright or dim enough, I like it really bright when I'm outdoors in a bright environment, and I like it dim in a darker environment, like when my lights are off; unfortunately it doesn't do either of those well enough, although the not-getting-dim-enough problem is the one I find more annoying of the two. Having said that however, when watching films, the colours and deep blacks due to OLED technology are AMAZING. The cameras are the only actual disappointment really, they are oversaturated, and dark colours just look black, it's really annoying. The detail is... fine, I expected better tbh. But please OnePlus, fix the colour processing with an update please! Luckily for me, I don't care too much about cameras, so not too much of an issue for me. But if you really do, may I point you in the direction of the Google pixel lineup.I honestly can't complain too much though. The cameras are still good for a £400 phone, it comes with a pre-applied (plastic) screen protector, and everything else is really premium including the build quality. It doesn't have an ip rating, but it does have some water protection around the sim tray, so I would guess, and what some reviewers have said, that they forego the rating to save costs, but still include the protection anyway.

Had a 1+7Pro for 18 months which was great but just a bit big and heavy.  This is 10% lighter and perhaps 5% shorter but that makes all the difference.  Feels perfect.  Fast, excellent software and OOS 11 is not as bad as people make out in terms of being non-stock. I can't really say I've noticed much difference from OOS 10 and this was one of my worries.  As usual, it comes with a screen protector already on it (may not be thick but it's there) and a clear TPU type case, which I usually end up buying anyway.  Always-on-display is just what I wanted, the new 65W warp charge is crazy and with a 2-3 day battery (I got that on the 1+7Pro anyway) you only charge it when you realise it's low, not over night or any of that panic.  It's loud, has stereo speakers (top one if a little tiny but fine), and just works.  I must admit the 8 is probably great too but it's the same price so why not get this.  As me anything, so far loving this phone.  Oh yes, not QHD+ like the pro was but it's so good I can't tell the difference really.Update after going to a 9pro. The 8T is probably one of the last good OnePlus phones which does everything well. I've seen this on here for £363 which frankly is a bargain. It isn't the smallest, prettiest device around, sure, but if you want a great phone which all works, with a very good screen, crazy fast charging for good value, this is it.

If you want more flexibility in this regard, a phone with a sonic scanner might be a better choice.The battery is a whopping 4500 mah and benefits from a 65 Watt fast charge which 1plus call 'warp charge', it takes just 29 minutes from zero to full battery. It's very impressive and takes any chore out of charging your device, a few other well known companies would benefit their consumers by following on the example of 1 plus in this regard.Only time will tell if the lack of ip68 water and dust protection will go on to reduce the longevity of the phone but so far, so good.Recommended.

Of course you get the usual battery degradation that you get with all smart phones, but that's never been an issue since the phone charges exceptionally fast, with an all day charge happening in like 30 mins.One thing I must bring up is that randomly the screen almost fell out of the phone. I was playing genshin impact at the time so maybe the glue got melted and the screen started to slide out? Either way if that's the case make sure you're careful not to get the phone too hot. If it weren't for this randomly just happening now I could easily see this being a phone I keep around for the next 3-4 years (after already having it for 2).

Seeing this feature in operation with my own eyes on my home network was one of those lightbulb moments that a) 5G is no joke or affectation; data transfer speeds are *everything* in mobile technology and b) whatever the share price says, Apple are dead in the water; their closed loop technology model makes so many things that should be effortless unnecessarily difficult if not impossible.  Having struggled with iTunes for the last 10 years and having used this phone for three weeks I would say confidently Apple are done, living on borrowed time and will eventually go the same way as Nokia.Data transfer, processing capacity and memory size are all fantastic but there are some issues.  First, battery life is poor.  OnePhone's warp charging is *really* fast but you are quickly aware that this phone has minimal battery capacity; if you are more than a moderate user and cannot recharge at least on a daily basis or dislike using an external portable charging source think very carefully about this phone.  Turning the gloomy default brightness (someone let marketing out if their padded cell to fiddle with the standard specs I think) up to something that is actually visible and shows the screens capabilities only makes the problem worse.  I am lucky in working from a desk, if I was on the road I would always have a couple of back up external batteries to hand; you are certainly going to need them.  Second the instructions with the phone are superficial, remote support is limited and the device has some usability howlers. The worst example of this, the phone's file system shows in File Explorer in an anonymous subfolder called AC2003 with a completely separate, unrelated and practically useless but boldly labelled OnePlus Directory complete with OnePlus logo that lists only the drivers.  Why didn't they put everything in a Folder called  ""OnePlus Nord?""...  I am not surprised to read several new users struggling initially to connect the phone to their PC...  Add to this their online support is very poor, I am typically kept hanging around for hours while some knownothing asks irrelevant questions pitched way above my head in an attempt buy time to read an online manual and in an attempt not to look stupid.  I would rate the online support 2/10 - it really is that bad.  So battery life and some issues about usability show I spent £400 rather than £1000 but overall I am hopeful it has enough processing, memory and data transfer horsepower  to future proof me and give the 8 years I got out of the iPhone.

Don't listen to the biased reviewers, decided to go for this one after giving Pixel 6 a try for a few months and it was like a breath of fresh air. 80w charging is something you can't overlook, especially since you get the actual charging brick in the box,plus a free case and a preinstalled screen protector. OnePlus have stuck to their super thin and light design, great built quality and the exterior is amazing (granted the camera module design is an acquired taste) no complaints there, at least from me. The phone looks super premium, fingerprint works flawlessly, God I missed that, especially whilst having been stuck with the pixel... Camera quality is up there, hardly the best but definitely not mediocre. 10bit shots can come up with some insane results, more than enough for the average every day user. The display is just out of this world, resolution is great, refresh rate I'd say matches the performance of my recently departed 8T. Battery life would vary, on a heavy duty day, I'd be at about 20% around 8pm-ish so can easily stretch to a full day depending on usage, mind you the super fast charging more than makes up for that. If you come from an earlier OnePlus, then the new incarnation of the oxygen os would be a bit of a disappointment but still dominating most of the alternatives on the market. Generally speaking if you're looking for that established OnePlus experience you can't go wrong, despite the relatively higher price point, I believe it's still more than worth it if you're considering OnePlus.

After some careful research I stumbled across the OnePlus 10 pro. Looking into many of the specifications that the new flagship devices had to offer I was surprised that my older Samsung still had many cutting edge features like screen resolution and storage capacity. So I was initially drawn to the s22 ultra, but seeing this in the flesh just reminded me of a note device, and those corners will ruin a decent pair of jeans. The s22 had inferior specs to my nearly 4 year old s10 + so that was a downgrade and wasn't prepared to pay for that. Now onto the OnePlus 10 pro, this has a superior chipset, screen, ram and looks so smart. The software is lightning fast and is super slick. This is the first time I have dieviated away from Samsung in decades but the oxygen software is a breeze. The charging with 80watts is nothing like I've ever experienced before, and even the wireless 50watts is faster than many wired devices today. The technology that OnePlus are delivering to their customers is fantastic. The camera is co developed by hassleblad and is amazing, it actually makes a wide lense usable instead of a gimic. Delivery was next day, set up was a breeze. I would highly recommend, and you get a pair of wireless, headphones... but only if you order quick!

I've had it for few months and think that if you're a gamer maybe this is your phone, but if you care about camera, weight, bulkiness, and finish maybe look somewhere else.CAMERA I don't understand why you would brag about the camera when it's so bad. Even after the latest update at the end of June 2022, pictures are massively overexposed, tone and saturation are bad as well. I like photography, and thought I could live with average pictures, but now I find myself editing pictures a lot because they are way out of line. Don't buy it if you care about the pictures and videos.SCREEN is beautiful, video quality is superb. But If this is your flagship phone and you're putting a premium screen, at least stick the screen protector professionally, the screen protector from factory is awful, I think they stuck mine dirty or there was something wrong with it, but you can see it's not well done. I've been using the phone for a few months now and the screen protector needs changing already, with just normal use.FACE RECOGNITION is not good compared to my wife's iPhone, and I'm not an iPhone fan at all.CHARGER IS MASSIVE but it does a great job, not the best for traveling though. Battery life is just fine, if you want it to last you'll have to deactivate all the good stuff.VERY HEAVY piece of work, you can feel it after handling it for long periods.SOUND is really good, the dolby atmos does the job great and the speakers are good.HEADPHONES' sound is good and nice premium finish, but they are bulky and bother me after long time use, mics are rubbish always have problems during phonecalls, can't control the volume which is a massive downside for me.

But still works well and is great for in app security such as internet banking.Facial recognition is brilliant and what I use most to unlock the phone. I just wish I could use it for in app security instead of the dinner print scanner.For the price, this phone is an absolute beast that shows your how over priced all the other flag ship phones are such as iPhone or Samsung's.One plus also has a brilliant community that the developers listen to and communicate with regularly.Super happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheaper but more powerful phone

Battery life better than expected when on standby (at least 2 days) and is acceptable when under heavy use (streaming video from Prime). However, as most videos and films are viewed in landscape mode, it would be nice to have a speaker at each end for stereo effect. Current single speaker OK but not spectacular. Lack of a 3.5mm socket is unfortunate, but Bluetooth works OK, and the phone is less liable to water ingress. Small notch works well for the front camera and really isn't intrusive, unlike some notches. Included flexible protective cover a useful addition but certainly isn't finger print resistant! In general a very nice phone which feels right in the hand, is good to look at, is great to use and represents value for money. Would bye it all over again!

The good: the Android OS is getting close to the Apple's in ease of use and design (yes, iOS is superior but isnt worth the considerable extra spend). The camera is good, pretty much what you'd expect for the mid-range price.The bad? A couple of tiny niggles with the UX maybe (i.e. you can't swipe to go back on Chrome)  but it's hard to find fault.A great phone, at a great price.

Footage can be a bit choppy when panning and the stabilisation can produce small jumps if you are not super smooth with your movements but it's as good if not better than the Pixel 2 and Galaxy 9 I tried for general video work.Dash charge is great, the things well built, battery life is up to two days so my only beef is with the curved screen which makes it nigh on impossible to get a screen protector to work.I opted for the official OnePlus 6t protector and its still not perfect with lift in the corners and a stange speckled pattern emerging after a few days near the top of the screen.I know this is a problem with almost all phones now but it really is irritating!Anyhow, it's decent phone at a decent price and a pleasing replacement to my venerable iPhone 6s.

It's much nicer and is very slick - that display. The fingerprint reader is a talking point and it's not as reliable or quick as on the 3T. It doesn't bother me and I'm living happily with it. The ebony wood bumper case I got compliments it really well. A transparent case does come with the phone which I didn't know about.I don't usual pay much attention to a device's speed and responsiveness when it's new. The real test is after six months of use which is when you know how good it is. So far, Android hasn't faired as well as the other device - maybe Pie will change my mind.Battery life has been excellent and after moderate to heavy use, I still get about 20-30% of battery life left from a single charge. Though I notice the app management is VERY aggressive killing off apps before you can blink! What's the 8GB of RAM for? It's irritating but not a showstopper.I haven't missed the audio jack at all but then again, I got myself a bluetooth headphone. The problem I find with the phone is I often can't quickly tell which side is up. You have to look for the front-facing camera and with the all black display it's not so obvious. Speaking of cameras, it gets the job done and I've received compliments of its pictures from folks with the other device. Maybe they were impressed or they had such low expectations to begin with....After the Desire, S2, One M8 and 3T, the 6T is a great upgrade and I would highly recommend it.

The facial ID and finger scanner are some of the best on the market on this phone, quick, snappy and they just work, both integrate with a few apps here and there and unlocking the phone is a breeze, I debate on just how secure the facial ID is but the finger scanner is top notch for its pricing.Design and style - Build quality on this is great, the weight is nice and it feels well assembled, the glass backing doesn't feel fragile in any way and the overall phone has a nice look (minus the notch, but thats a personal taste and can be more or less made invisible in the settings)Features - All in all, a lot of the features crammed in here just work really well, being able to swipe directions to pause and skip songs with the screen still off is great, and theres more like those buried in the settings, OP really listened to their consumers when making their phones and it shows.Battery life - Not having to worry about battery life is such a quality of life improvement, the battery will easily last a day for most heavy users, mine can usually go 2 days or so before needing a top up, which is done extremely quickly.Cons:Charging cables - It's very much a nitpick, but the power cable supplied with this phone is just too short, couple that with the seemingly permanent coiling I have with my wire, it makes it very short indeed and given you don't benefit from the quickcharge with most other cables you may have around, I'd reccomend looking into a longer one, especially hearing poor reliability long term with the standard charging cable, just ensure you buy a quickcharge supported one to avoid disappointments.Fingerprint scanner placement - This one I don't need to spell out too much, but the placement of the scanner and cameras being so close, it's just a fact that the camera is getting smudged now and again by a finger or two, more of an inconvenience than anything but you will get used to this over time.Default Music Player - Upon launching I discovered OnePlus doesn't actually have their own designed music player, instead piggybacking off of Googles Music player, which is no terrible thing for most, but the app lacks in depth and customisation and gets pushy for paid version upgrades (I reccomend switching to either Shuttle or Black Player, I tried both and stuck with Shuttle out of familiarity but both are great players for what they are)Weirdness and other Miscellaneous items:Data transferral -  This model of phone doesn't have an SD card slot as you may or may not know (This nearly caught me when picking out 64 or 128gb of space too) which is no biggie as the space options provided are plentiful, it is an issue when the OP6 didn't actually transfer my data from my original phones SD card too, opting to only move the data from the internal on my old phone, which was only my applications and not the images, music and other such things I planned on, easy enough to transfer manually but an inconvenience I shouldn't have really had.Headphone jack placement - Pause to appreciate the headphone jack still making an appearance, moving on - Located on the bottom of the phone, it can be a little weird picking the phone out, and placing the jack at the top (phone upside down in this case) and then wondering where the buttons are (My old phone had the jack at the top and muscle memory kicks in, such and such)All things considered, truly a great phone option that I'd reccomend to anyone

Battery life is excellent, screen is bright and clear, call quality is excellent, GPS is is fast and accurate and regular updates are reassuring.Camera is excellent but I don’t use it often enough to give a ‘professional’ camera review, but it’s good enough for me even in low light shots.Few negatives are:I only use the phone for calls, Sat Nav and very light internet search, so can’t comment on gaming capabilities, the launcher froze on me a few times however, even with light use (Too many times considering the price), I could still see my wallpaper but all icons disappeared, only way to have it responding again was to use gestures for ‘home’ button, then clear recent applications. Launcher then starts again. But still, for very light use? It’s disappointing.Other disappointment is fingerprint scanner, I chose the OP6 over OP6T because of the physical fingerprint scanner, it does fail to recognise my fingerprint too many times. Previous phone was a 3 years old Honor 8, on the course of those 3 years, I probably had to rescan my fingerprint less times than I had to do with the OP6 in 3 months, which is disappointing, regardless of the price of the handset.Overall? Few let downs, but excellent battery life and overall performance make up for it. Hopefully regular future software updates will resolve the few launcher/fingerprint scanner issues and enhance the overall experience.

I decided to go with the 6 and what a bargain.OK, I lost a bigger battery, slightly bigger screen and in-display fingerprint reader but gained a headphone jack, a notification light and £80 over the 6T.Upgrade to pie and Oxygen 9. Straight away so in essence the same experience.Did quite a bit of research on oneplus and definitely not disappointed.

Worth it for the slo-mo camera feature alone, but does everything else you'd expect from an android smartphone. It's fast. Gets my vote!  Video zoom is great - & great for photos too. One point to bear in mind is that with the slo-mo video, zoom cannot be used ..& it doesn't record audio for slo-mo..  However, with the ultra-slow speed at a decent resolution it really is an awesome thing.

I tend not to follow other reviews, but take on sensible points made. I had an Samsung S10 before and after using for the last 5 weeks, I definitely made the right choice with this. I was amazed at the price to start with, much cheaper than going direct to OnePlus even with their discounts.The phone is slick, I don't mind the jade green, I have a black carbon skin over it. It's very fast, brilliant screen, great camera and generally can't find any fault with it. Yes it has no wireless charging, really, I didn't use it before. Yes it has no 3.5mm Jack, I just use wireless/ Bluetooth; I bought a USB c adapter, job done for a few pounds!!Speakers are great for video playback and streaming my Spotify still sounds great. As for software, I have had no problems, it flies. As for the 5g connectivity, could not get it before, so not going to miss what I can't get; but if I ever need it, then I will just change network if I need it, but really don't care tbh. For me at the price it was a no brainer, the others can keep their £1000+ phones, I am very happy with my purchase.UPDATE as of 19/06/22:So after some 8 months of use my positive review still stands; the phone is still just as good as when I first got it. Battery life is still amazing, camera is brilliant so really cannot fault it at all. I recently worked in Cardiff and for the first time I got 5g and it worked great.A few weeks ago I got the Android 12 update, again no issues, all working fine :)

OnePlus,"OnePlus 8T 5G 12GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with Quad Camera, 65W Warp Charge and Dual SIM - Aquamarine Green - 2 Year Warranty",,https://www.amazon.co.uk/OnePlus-Storage-SIM-Free-Smartphone-Camera/dp/B07XY79DZ5/ref=sr_1_45?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.eBBZsPdqPIeTqv0XxDug9gVTc585yw_Ug5kMEdGewK4fvMi4GkuVaq9L4g8NHipz5XoJi1X4m_qDjfwY876QWxy0E0Me-Mz6iwiPGXNjaNwbDiW7yTlfuImEpvXASFNJjBxIyeyVX-o1YjM3_VmIy3-41ztxqn3gVfyWKyt-qe_EXvsXix-L4VxQaB3PXvVkGOOw8feWiKX93-4cMAEvdsznRXoHxnaUOBNTqHzynC4NHf8HTRUeAd45lQw5htLgfJpjuOrq98kQYMfvGYsdm1A-Jp0RVmg6v4ZzBs1cnAI.3-KBJc3vhD6_OabLPM1UJrUNOhKF1JaM_cMObIkQ44w&dib_tag=se&qid=1714768831&refinements=p_89%3AOnePlus&rnid=1632651031&s=telephone&sr=1-45,Setting the standard,"Finally upgraded to the OnePlus 8T from the OnePlus 6 after deciding NOT to go for the OnePlus 9. I initially got the 8gb Ram 128gb storage model for £450 (down from £550 rrp) as the price difference between that and the 12gb Ram 256gb storage was £200! I had the phone for about a week and it was absolutely amazing but something did not sit right. It felt quick but not ""fast."" A week later I just happened to be browsing Amazon and saw the 12gb 256gb version of the 8T was reduced to £550 down from £650. So I returned the 8gb model in favour of the 12gb and let me tell you...what an absolute difference. (Hats off to Amazon for their no quibble returns policy).The 12gb ram makes all the difference and it baffles me why this is not a standard amongst all high end smart phones. I use an app called Simple System Monitor which shows me my CPU and Ram usage. The phone without any apps running was using 5.5gb of ram so when I was using ram intensive apps on the 8gb model...the android OS was closing apps that were opened the earliest to make way for the newly opened apps as the ram usage was maxing out. Using the 12gb model makes this a non-issue because the extra 4gb of ram means that more apps can be open without the need to close others and results in the phone operating a lightning quick speeds.Along with bigger ram, the 8T boasts an Octo-Core Snapdragon 865 processor which makes light work of everything I use my phone for including the 120hz display which just makes everything so fluid and lush. YouTube videos look absolutely amazing and realistic as if you are actually filming it yourself and games look incredibly detailed. Throw in 256gb storage and a 48 Megapixel camera capable of recording 4K videos and you have yourself a serious phone. If you are a gamer then the Adreno 650 graphics chip will more than suit your needs as it works amazingly with the processor and ram. It also has all the other features that you’d expect from a smartphone these days such as Blueooth 5.1, NFC etcThe phone itself is quite heavy weighing in at 188g but then again so was my OnePlus 6 so that is not an issue. It feels well built and premium compared to other phones as it has an Aluminium frame with a gorilla glass front and back. It has a 4500mah battery which can be fully charged in 30 minutes via 65W Warp Charge. This will last up to 2 days of normal use however, if you use the phone constantly then you can probably get about 5-6 hours out if it. The 12gb model comes in an Aqua Marine Green colour which I have to admit doesn’t look as good as the Lunar Silver the 8gb comes in however, my phone is permanently in an official OnePlus 8T protective case so this isn’t an issue for me.Downsides: -- No headphone jack rendering my wired Sennheiser Headphones obsolete.- On screen finger-print scanner can be temperamental.- Doesn’t work well with 3rd party tempered glass screens, 1st party expensive.I fully recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade to a high end flagship killer smartphone. It is barely 6 months old and yet still thrashes a lot of other smartphone brands including Samsung. Yes, the OnePlus 9 is available and it is “newer” but unless you are an absolute tech geek or just have too much money to burn then I recommend the OnePlus 8T 12gb Ram model.

Never any slowdown, like ever. Screen is bright, clean and crisp, Storage is huge, so never a problem there too. Camera really good tooPhone is perfect size & weight, and looks great. Sliiiiiiightly on the thick side though? But that just enables a larger battery. Lasts more than a day and charges in about 10 minutes. No exaggeration.One of the things I love most about oneplus phones is that the never seem to get any worse as they get older. They last  years each, and even then they are still great phones and are just as quick as the day I bought them - I generally only replace them for cosmetic damage that's my fault. My family still use my old oneplus5 as our backup phone and it's still just grand!

It's usually near half the price of the latest, but with almost the same features. This is a classic example.12 GB RAM. 256 GB storage. 5G compatibility. A sumptuous AMOLED screen. Astonishingly good cameras. Screaming-fast processors. Shockingly swift charge using the included charger. It even comes with a clear bumper case!There is literally nothing not to like about this phone. At the price, it's an absolute steal, blowing Apple and Samsung (to name two of similar quality) out of the water.There's a single gotcha. As with a lot of other modern phones, OnePlus has eliminated the headphone socket. You'll need to buy either a USB-C headset or a Bluetooth one. Fortunately, you can now get a decent USB-C headset for under a tenner, so I'm not going to deduct a star for that.My last OnePlus (5) has lasted four years, and is still going. I've only replaced it because OnePlus has stopped providing software updates. I expect this 8T to last as long.

The base model was £298 to £320, with the option of the ear buds bundle i acquired it for £347. Which for a mid range phone is absolute bang for value. But the phone is currently at £400+ which seems to be stretching it. at that point you may as well opt for a ""Google Pixel 6A"" which is ranked as the best value for a mid range phone.But Enough of the value for quality and performance. Does it preform well.... Yes!Bellow i will list everything great about the phone.- The  Nord 2T sports a hefty quad core mediatek dimensity 1300 CPU, With an ARM Mali-G77 MC9 GPU. You will always find the phone responsive in every circumstances, Offers above average performance when gaming however might have issues on certain open world games.- The Nord 2T Sports a brilliant 8GB of ram for a mid range phone with an option to expand memory capacity by an additional 2-3-5GB within the operation system itself. This converts 2-3-5GB from your internal storage capacity to be used as RAM for the phone to take advantage of. For those of you that are a serious hoarder of apps being on in the background. this is a dream feature for a mid range phone!- Fingerprint scanner allows you to save multiple fingerprints if you like unlocking your phone with different fingers.- SUPERCHARGING.... im not joking here when i say that this phone can charge dam quick which is great and concerning at the same time. For a battery perspective charging this quick is concerning as it will degrade the battery incredibly quickly. But on the other hand it means if you need the phone charged in a flash it will fully charge a dead phone from 0 to 100% in under 30mins. in order to preserve battery life if you do decide to acquire this phone i would recommend at every step to enable all charging features so as it does not degrade the battery as quickly.- Camera quality is top note. offers ultra wide photography as well as probably one of the best low light/night time video recording and photo taking processing. Doesn't oversaturate it as much as you would think but proves that in low light conditions its brilliant.My overall recommendation is if you can grab this bellow £360. its 100% one the money, anything more youre looking at compromising value for money which there is far greater options available bellow the current price point of the phone which is at £403, But this is just my advise. But at current value i dont see why it would be worth it considering the One Plus Nord 10t just launched and is sitting at £463, which provides far superior processing, and GPU capabilities ontop of a better battery and the same expandability with your RAM, Youre looking at an average 34% increase in performance for an additional £60

Camera and phone review.,"I've had the phone a few days now and here are my first impressions.As a videographer and occasional photographer I value certain things in my phone and whilst this handset is by no means the creme de la creme of smartphones but I think it deserves a lot of praise for what it does well.These days I'm not able to afford the flagships with their top end camera systems, but this is one of those handsets that makes you ask if you really need to anymore.The last ""flagship I used  was the Huawei P20 Pro. In fact I'm going to be mentally comparing quality of that handset to the main camera here in the Nord 2T. The other 2 lenses are poor and there to make up numbers, but a few years ago even our flagships packed one good camera and we were mostly happy.Today it's surprising how good phones are at capturing sharp video and images. The lightness of this handset is appreciated and there are times when it's simply not convenient to use a dedicated camcorder or my old DSLR (I'm yet to justify the jump to a superior mirrorless system).Comparing my old P20 Pro, a phone lauded for it's cameras in 2018, I have to say I'm really impressed. Autofocus on the Nord 2T is sharp, fast and accurate, the p20 would seratch for focus as soon as there was lots of movement in the frame when videoing, resulting in lots of out of focus, unuseable footage. Details are good and low light performance seems bettrr in my limited testing. Yes, there are better cameras, but for the price, this is a great little handset.I'd personally like more controls, the ability to disable OIS when my phone is mounted on my gimbal, but this phone shoots way better video than my older P20 Pro, a weakness of that handset.Still Images seem sharp, maybe overshsrpened, detailed but over processed as is the norm for Chinese phones who seem to prefer images that pop over those more natural. I quite like the look though. Low light performance of the main 50MP camera is strong for the price and better than my older handset. At 50MP, a 2x digital zoom (crop) is still a decent image and surprisingly usable . I don't zoom my images normally, preferring to crop in post, but I'd have no qualms here shooting at 2x for online use as images are detailed and sharp.The pnone itself is really nice to use. Yes, I'd prefer a more stock android as certain changes the OxygenOS 12 has made are not as good as the original Google implementation. Settings menus especially are overcomplicated and certain elements of the Material You design language does appear lost in this and every other Chinese translation I've seen.That said, I'm used to Chinese UIs by now and they tend to add lots, even if the first thing I do is put either Nova or Lawnchair launcher on them for a more stock skin. What I don't like is the default to the iPhone style home screens. We Android users like our app drawer, we don't want the chaos of multiple homescreens of randomly placed icons greeting us after a backup from our accounts onto our new handset. It takes time to clean up this mess but once done, this, is as simple to use as any other in day to day usage.The interface is snappy, the battery simply good, not amazing. It'll easily last most users a full 24 hours and when it doesn't, charging on the boxed 80w charger is simply lightning. 0% to full in about 30 mins. It doesn't get too hot, I've had no real hiccups in my first few days with it. The odd stutter but generally, apps load quicklyand everything seems as fast as any top end phone I remember using.The handset design is a mixed bagThere is something a little disconcerting about the cross eyed, off centre camera alignment, the design itself possible works, though the camera bump is pretty massive and you certainly can't lay this thing at all flat until you put it in the supplied case and even then it isn't flat, but I like aspects of the design. The shadow grey frosted glass back may not pick up fingerprints, but it's a slippery and whilst feeling quality I don't think I'll be pulling this out to look at it as I did with the P20 Pro or even my old Oppo Find x2 Neo I used as my daily handset until recently. It's not the most attractive handset I've owned in all honesty but I bought this for function over form and it feels sturdy and premium, works well and was a great price.The biggest area where I am not impressed is the quality of the built in stereo speakers. With bluetooth 5.2 and aptX I'm unlikely to have to worry too much but I was disappointed in all honesty as these were a step back not only on the previous Huawei Handsets I'd owned (Mate 9 was brilliant), but worse than the Find X2 Neo which I loved (except for it's mediocre camera performance).. If you need to use them they are there, but they're pretty terrible, bassless and prone to distort at high volumes when playing music. Watching streaming services they sounded better, but they're lacklustre at best and when pushed sound exactly like the cost cutting, cheaply made speakers they are.Brightness of the screen is the only other criticism. I'm yet to use it on a bright sunny day, but outdoors it's not the brightest. I do hope I don't regret this when filming my partners American football practices on sunny days but it's just not very bright. Everything else, indoors I'm happy with the HDR 10+ screen. It's everything you expect from an AMOLED screen and the 90Hz makes the android experience smoother, I just wish it got brighter outdoors.To conclude, the Oneplus Nord 2T is a good handset for the money. Its not going to win prizes in a beauty contest and isn't flawless but you can't expect flawless in the midrange. It's got a good main camera (I didn't review the other 2 lenses as they are pretty pointless) and everything else is as good as it should be with the odd niggle, but overall this handset is a rapid little performer than makes using it a breeze and a pleasure.

This problem could just be an issue with my phone though.For the price I am happy with the phone, I have purposely not downloaded many apps so the processing speed does not reduce, as my 7s was not broken, it was just really slow, I am able to use the 7s for the 3 games I play occasionally and the shopping apps I need, so allowed me not to have to download apps that could slow my phone down.I cannot go into technical details because I do not understand the technical side, what is important to me is that the phone works as I am severely disabled and housebound so having a reliable phone is not only important for me but also for my family to be able to contact me, the processing speed is good and I can take nice photos of my family. The apps that were already installed do not seem to slow the phone down and apps I would never use have been uninstalled which is an added bonus because I have had phones in the past where you have to have pre installed apps and could not remove them. I use my home Internet on the phone but living in the middle of the country the Internet can go down sometimes, so I will need to use my data that I can watch Netflix, prime and you tube, with the phone being bigger it makes watching the above really easy.If like me you want a no nonsense phone that is easy to use this is an ideal choice. I am sure there are many other things you can do with the phone as both my sons have said they could use the phone and still able to everything they do on there way more expensive phones, so to me this is a very good phone and not too expensive.

Highly recommended.","I bought the HONOR 90 Lite to replace my 5.5 year old Honor 9 Lite which was starting to show signs of age. Previous to this, I was stuck in the extortion Apple bubble.  Thanks to the availability of so many affordable, reliable, and high quality android brands, I decided to make the brave transition and have never looked back with any regret.Having used this Honor 90 Lite for a month,  I am very pleased with the upgrade and hugely impressed by the quality / features / price ratio. The vastly improved specifications is a huge leap forward compare to the 9  Lite with only 3gb RAM, 32gb Storage, a 3000mah battery, and a 13 MP main camera.  Thanks to the the main stars which are the generous 8gb RAM and the whopping 256gb storage, this phone is extremely snappy and a pleasure to operate.  The 100MP main camera takes brilliant photos, while the larger screen and the ultra thin bezel deliver a much improved visual experience.With the unique Honor app DEVICE CLONE, I was able to transfer all datas ( including all my downloaded APPS) from the old HONOR to the new HONOR effortlessly using a C to C cable ( an adaptor is needed on the old phone as it is a micro USB).  The only APP that I had to apply more work is WHATSAPP, as I wanted all my contacts and chat history to be transferred as well.There are some drawbacks including lack of 3.5 jack, no internal memory card slot, lower screen brightness, and the screen is LCD and not AMOLED.  However, I can accept the minor compromise as I don’t feel like paying £100 more for these features found in the Redmi Note 13 5G with similar camera size, memory and storage capacity.As technology changes so rapidly theses days, the relatively affordable price of this reliable Chinese phone means that I can upgrade to newer technology more often without feeling guilty.

Not really a worry considering it's applicable with other chargers around the house.Other than that be prepared for this phone's finish. It's very premium and looks and feels great. Very smooth glass.However the one downside I found! 100% buy yourself a case and screen protector alongside your purchase. The oils in your fingers and hand make the phone just slip right out of your grip and would be very easy to drop. I got a screen protector and a wallet style case which worked fine.Other than that, if this phone broke or I lost it, I'd straight away buy the same phone as a replacement. It's features and specs are top notch for the price.No need to sign up for a two year contract to buy into a ""brand"" name with half the features and specs.The HONOR brand nailed it out the box with this one.Deffinately consider this for a next phone!

That meant I only paid £175 for my new Honor magic 5 lite.

The HONOR's thumbprint reader is such a great way to lock/unlock the phone and I've got to say the camera for a phone of this price is also surprisingly impressive. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, but that's probably more a sign of me being old fashioned and stuck in my ways since those ports are being phased out on newer tech as far as I can tell.Would recommend this phone to anyone looking for something modestly priced but fiercely competitive in terms of specs and speed. Oh... and the battery life is blowing my mind. Not having to charge it every day is going to take some getting used to and I'm loving it.

Unfortunately I missed this in the specs, as the x6 and x7 have memory expansion.To people who who use the cloud and streaming services and don't have masses of files to store, they may be happy with this phone. To me it's a massive downgrade, I'd rather have a slower processor and fewer megapixels. Another thing I noticed, can't really blame it on this particular phone but a 6.7 inch screen makes the phone too big to practically carry around it, doesn't fit in all pockets. Quite a disappointment I'm left wishing I bought the lower specified x7a or even x6.After using this phone on WiFi for a couple of months I have noticed that it is quicker, better photos, and Bluetooth than my old phone. The fast charger works brilliantly and I definitely prefer this screen for Internet and also WhatsApp calls.I still think it's a shame they left out the expansion slot but have raised my review from 2 stars to 4 because the phone works so well.

It's also worth pointing out that the audio experience is pretty good. Depending on the music app you don't have to play around with the volume settings to much and it produces decent play back levels (Even better with a good set of headphones). Overall, I would recommend it, just bear in mind that you are buying a supposed budget device and it does have its limitations.

The picture quality is not good if you zoom in and the dark to light aperture fails to capture the colours unlike other top of the range phones.  The price is excellent, at only £145 its hard to see why anyone else would buy other phones at 7,6,8 or more times the price.

However it does state in the Amazon description that it does.While this is not a deal breaker, you should expect a phone of this price to come with everything in the description.Also the Amazon deal at the time of my purchase promised free headphones (worth £400) they didn't come and on contacting Amazon, they didn't have any idea of this promo, so another star off. they have since taken this deal down.The phone itself is snappy and great really premium feel, though many apps wont go into split screen though, so you will have to put up with floating windows side by side a lot. your paying for the novelty of having a thin fold phone more than anything

I have an Honor watch and I couldn't connect the thing! The play store app wouldn't work, so I had to use an apk site, that didn't work either. I read and watched all the YouTube videos on how to do it, and still no luck. I'm tech savvy, so I think I know my stuff. But this has frustrated me for six hours! I've found a work around and thankfully it works. You have to download the petal health app from the play store btw. 👍Also another big concern, you can't use split screen mode! So if you're used to using two apps simultaneously, you can't! There's a work around for this too, download an app in the play store called split screen and that has worked for my main two apps I use for split screen.I haven't had much chance to test the rest, but I'll give it a go and update this review. Hopefully I don't find anything else wrong and have to send it back.**upadated ** 11/11/22Ive had the phone a month now, it's great. Pros :Face unlock is incredible, even in the dark.The fingerprint scanner is fantastic too.The camera is great as point and shoot.Charging speeds! Unbelievable.Cons :Battery doesn't last me as long, I have to typically put it on charge at 19:00-20:00. By this stage I'm down to 20%, but the 100w charger takes care of this.You can't find a decent case for it.That's it. Great phone, with a few quirks.Updated - 7/12/22I tried the Oppo find x5 pro for a day and I quickly went back to this phone. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and the 3d face unlock is far superior.

I was almost away to buy an on the cheaper end Samsung Galaxy.I was sceptical about a brand I’d never heard of but it had far more advantages than the Galaxy and the reviews were good.I couldn’t afford a brand new one,so I bought a used one.That seemingly had a few big scratches and no charger etc.Just the phone.They sent me a split new one!.The phone is wonderful.Every bit as good as the famous brands.The camera is amazing and better than my Apple and Sony Xperia and my boyfriend s GooglePixel in fact he’s thinking of upgrading to this.Never again will I buy phones just because of the designer name. The picture and graphics quality are brilliant and bright.Great big screen for watching Netflix and YouTube!Over the moon I didn’t buy that Galaxy!.Honestly, I am positive Honor is going to be a name you hear of a lot in mobiles in the future Ifyou’re in the market for a phone.Please look no further this is the one. You have been lucky to find it.Don’t hesitate just press that Buy Now button.Because this one’s a winner.Enjoy!.X.UPDATE Couple of months ,on and this is the best phone I’ve ever had.Absolutely fantastic.It has everything you could need.Sound and picture quality astounding.Holds it’s charge like a Trojan!.My friends are well Jell at the size of the screen cos’ it’s bigger than theirs!.Ok,it might not have that little bitten Apple on the back of it that people seem to love,but it’s just as good,just as fantastic,and a saving of at least £700.So good,despite owning an iPad.I went and bought their tablet(pad 8) that’s just as amazing as their phone.This upcoming company is a powerhouse I swear .I will be buying their products from now on.This phone is up there with the best.I asked you to press that Buy Now button a couple of months ago and if you haven’t already, you need to now.Astounding bit of kit.Thrilled with it and I just know you will be to!X

Amazon UK are clearly the seller.UPDATEIn the interim, I have tried to get a postal repair but found that the warranty expired 6 months before I bought it.

But I've just got bored.Ive been looking for along time at what I could find that's new and decided it would be the find x3 neo or the OnePlus 9. (OnePlus is basically oppo anyway) I'm so glad I went with this one and I'll explain why.Build Quality:build quality it great, I love the colour, I went with galactic silver and it's beautiful, I love how it changes colour depending on how the light reflects off it. It has a nice matted glass back that doesnt show fingerprints (none at all) although this does make it feel a little bit like plastic but it's better than being smudgy and ugly all the time! The phone does have a bit of weight to it but also surprisingly light for the size, but it's enough to feel premium, the craftsmenship being up there with Samsung!Display:The screen is one of the best, covered with gorilla glass 5 and a nice screen protector out the box, it has a slight curve on the edges but doesn't seem to cause any issues with accidental touches, the 90hz refresh rate is nice, obviously not up there with the 120hz powerhouses but it's definitely a win over iPhones 60hz... The colours are amazing and is a truly great panel! HDR10+  also supported.Camera:Exceptional actually, it really is a great camera, there's 4 built in but I'm not really sure what part they all play as I focus more on the standard modes, with portrait mode also being a great go to that works probably just as well as Samsung and apples offering.. not up there with pixel but it's not far off, good dynamic range, white balance and focus, everything's good and I'm really surprised by how much it impressed me!Software:This is what sold it for me, I mean it's android so.. well... It's android! and I know what to expect, but it's the other bits, the color os and oppo bits that made it for me, it's fun and different ( a good change) how long it'll last on me I don't know, but I am loving the experience! It's clean and modern, little animations here and there and features everywhere! You can also personalise it as much as you like.. now when you first set it up the standard home screen mode is a little annoying and doesn't have the app draw but after navigating round the settings I was able to change it! Talking of the settings app, this is probably my only complaint, things are difficult to find in here and navigating is a pain to say the least, nothing is where you expect it to be and it's all a bit confusing, I just stick to typing what I want into the search and let it present itself to me! It's annoying but not a turn off.So to summerise a few pros and consPros-- build quality- camera- screen- software-its differentCons-- No wireless charging- the odd stutter when doing some tasks- last year's processor- no waterproofing or dust resistance ratingOverall I'm really happy with this phone, and just thought I'd share these points with anyone thats maybe not sure on their next phone, it shouldn't disappoint!I think I might be a new oppo fan

It seems very quick and without hesitation in everything it does.With 256GB of memory, there's plenty to spare even when I load up with a lot of music to play in the car.I have the silver version - which is stylish and IMHO, looks good! Overall, everything seems to be well made and sturdy. The mobile has a reasonable weight and feels good in the hand.The display and the cameras are brilliant.  Charging is amazingly rapid and the device comes with a silicon case and a ready fitted film type screen protector.The Android 11 implementation is reasonably ""vanilla"" without an overload of bloatware. What there is, can mostly be easily disabled if necessary.I used the OPPO cloning app on my old Xiaomi and remarkably all my settings, data, media files and apps transferred over rather painlessly. I've not had that before! I presume life was made easier by both mobiles being on Android 11.Just one app failed to transfer - and I simply reloaded it from Google Play. I then deleted some of the Xiaomi bloatware that managed to make it across.I did have to manually set up the Home Screen in my preferred ""drawer"" mode. I also added ""File Manager +"" as it also provides seamless local network access to our home NAS/Media Server. So, I can download music and films, and upload photos etc.I have had no issues with WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth. 5G gives some amazing data transfer rates. Battery life is usually more than sufficient for me for a day.So, overall I am most chuffed! The mobile is a joy to use with performance at a par with many flagship devices. The Amazon option of 12 monthly payments make it a viable alternative to a long term agreement - with the flexibility and savings of a ""SIM Only"" contract.However, this is not a cheap device and there are a couple of small gripes:- No glass screen protectors work on this device as keyboard and fingerprint sensor sensitivity are lost rendering the mobile unusable. So, unlike me, don't remove the factory fitted film screen protector! I have had to replace it with a soft 'hydrogel' one...- It appears to be impossible to lose the Google app from the home screen tabs (RH swipe). I managed to get rid of it on my Xiaomi but OPPO seem to have blocked that option. You can disable ""Discovery"" (that chews data in the background) but Google Search annoyingly remains.....- The mobile is dust rather than water-proof.- There is only a small choice of cases available - particularly wallet/flip types.Wireless charging would have been great but the rapid charge capability does compensate.

This phone take amazing quality pictures and I cannot fault Oppo on that front. The phone's interface is great and somewhere between Huawei and Samsung I would say but a really great interface. On the downside, the screen picks up fingerprints easily so I find I am contantly cleaning it. In addition, there are a few small features that I am missing from ther phones I had before such as that I can only access my camera from the lock screen, but not my flashlight or calculator. When in my picture gallary, I cannot select to edit a picture through other editing software on my phone directly, I need to open the reloevant software and find the relevant picture again. As I said, very small things that would make a big difference to my use of the phone but I am not regretting my purchase. I would definitely buy this phone again.

I decided on the Find X5 lite.I like Oppo, the specs looked like an affordable improvement on my old phone.

It even had a USB A to C adapter in the box. Followed the instructions and was quickly done.Hardware:-  CPU is reasonably quick, the 8gb of RAM makes multitasking smooth. The screen is great, Amoled is vibrant, I have never used a 90hz phone screen and I love it.Cameras:- are fine. I mainly do landscape photography and the weather has made that hard to testStorage: 256gb plus a micro SD gives plenty of space for apps and files.Power:- 4,500 mah gives a full day of regular use. The included (please note Apple!) 65w quick charger gets you back to work quickly.Conclusion:- Very happy, loads of quality of life benefits , capable hardware

Having owned it for just a few days and having pushed all its features to the limits and more, I can only say ""What a gem"". It is fast enough to please me and everything on it works well and very smoothly. A year or so ago I had a Galaxy S10 and this Oppo blows it away. Now I'm an old codger and not a gamer so I can't speak to its abilities there, but, if you are a grown-up who wants a smoothly operating phone and would like a bargain I can certainly give this my blessing!

Only downside is the battery life. It's clearly improved since release from the earlier reviews but is still not great.As I said the display is phenomenal. By default it is set to standard. First thing you should do is change it to high in the settings. This thing supports a qhd+ display so use it.If you are constantly using it then expect a day and a half battery life from 80% charge. The major bonus is the charger. It will charge from 20% to 80% in 20 minutes max. Ridiculously fast. Wireless charging is fast as well. In my car in charges 1% per minute.Great phone.

What I've noticed so far is that the battery life seems a tad bit better and the face recognition is sooo fast compared to the Samsung. Plus with the software update it came with a new feature. It hides notifications if someone other than you is looking at the screen, superb.Point and shoot camera looks very similar to the s22 ultra, more real life colours with the oppo.Small things that annoy me with the Oppo, but hopefully this changes. Software updates aren't as fast at coming through as Samsung, and you can't really buy a decent (spigen) case for the oppo yet.All in all, the phone is great, lovely looking, albeit in a case, nice in the hand, and can hardly feel it in your pocket.The screen isn't as bright as the Samsung, but what screens are. Samsung won't sell their best displays to rivals.Great phone so far. 👍

The spec is first rate, it comes with a fitted screen protector, a superfast charger which is incredibly fast, basically charge the phone within 45 min from flat. Samsung you don't even get a charger these days, that's an extra £45! The phone also came with a case which fits the phone lovely.Speed of the Oppo is great, has everything my Samsung had, it actually fits better in my hand than my previous Samsung. The finger and face recognition is super quick and it works, if I wear sun glasses it doesn't recognise me. As I pre-ordered I get ear buds, a smart watch, a wireless charger and another case. I will not be going back to Samsung. Seriously, if you've always been a Samsung user like me, don't feel nervous about making the switch, you won't regret it, I haven't!

It quickly upgraded to Android 13. I have the usual company apps, teams, outlook and all managed with a company provided app for identity verification. While the face recognition works it does remind you every 72 hours to input your PIN, Our company needs a minimum 8 digit pin (yup) so you need to do ""choose another"" in the menu to allow an 8 digit pin. I also use it to hotspot into the company on the laptop when at a client site, at 5G.Battery life is very, very good. I am usually charging it once every 3-4 days, use dependent of course.As per company policy I have to keep it updated, and Android 13 was offered so I installed it.It is a dual SIM phone and as a user of dual SIM I can highly recommend for travel, i.e. buy a local SIM payg and use your 'home' SIM for receiving verification codes only.I am considering buying a second A77 to replace a data dongle which are mostly 4G only, and using the dual SIM to have 2 different PAYG plans for (personal) data when needed in remote locations, mobile phone coverage varies of course. I have found some poor 4G locations have good 5G coverage.The camera I would call 'good enough'. I need to share photos of equipment or status screens with colleagues. It only has 2 settings, a wide and closer. If you're not using the 2nd SIM you can put a micro SDXC card in it. The slots appear to be sealed with gaskets so I think it is waterproof too.It has a 3.5 mm headphone socket which is really handy for those 'con calls' privacy.It comes in the box with a clear case (cover) and there is a screen protector fitted but it is a plastic one not a glass one so easily scratched. Also comes with a high speed mains charger.I have a personal Samsung phone as well and there's little to choose between them. My Samsung can take 2 SIMs AND an SDXC memory card but doesn't charge as fast.Has proved very reliable so far so at the price it is excellent.

Just a bit of photography, video watching and browsing, along with 5G usage can have a dramatic drain to the battery life. With normal usage, it would last most of the day easy, yet with such heavier usage, it may not last half a day without the need to recharge. Otherwise, it is more than a perfect phone.

In comparison the Find X5 Pro feels much heavier, 226g compared to the Reno's 172g. Personally I prefer that, but that'll be a matter of personal choice.Physically the Find X5 Pro looks pretty in pictures but is completely impractical to keep hold of unless it's in a case as the ceramic material it's made from is super slippery. I've gone for a case from GOGME as it gives the most protection around the camera lenses.I chose the Find X5 Pro as it was reduced by £310 to £739 on a Black Friday deal and I wanted to get the best camera I could within reason. The camera does seem excellent, 50mp for standard and 50mp for wide angle with brilliant low light capabilities. The zoom isn't very good in comparison, being 13mp 2x optical but really only a Samsung S22 Ultra has a half decent zoom lens (for twice the price of the Oppo), and that's still nowhere near as good as a superzoom compact camera. I've got a Nikon A1000 35x optical to cover that requirement.The battery fitted by Oppo has a rated life of 1600 cycles (maintaining 80% of charge) compared to 500 for Apple and Samsung. Only time will tell if that claim is true but with a daily charge that's over 4 years without noticeable degradation.The face recognition seems excellent and the screen is superb as you'd expect from something that launched at well over £1000.The one thing the Find X5 Pro and Reno4 Pro 5G share is an utterly useless fingerprint reader built into the screen. I work in an industry where I use my hands so the top later of skin on my fingers is often damaged. Simply put, the fingerprint reader just doesn't work. With or without screen protector makes no difference.Compared to old Motorolas I've had with the sensor on the back which always worked perfectly regardless of how chewed up my fingers were the Oppos are a huge disappointment. Perhaps for office types who never do manual work the fingerprint reader works OK but not for us manual types.Out of the box the Find X5 Pro had ColorOS 12 (Android 12) installed but within a few hours it had done a couple of upgrades to that, and then and upgrade to ColorOS 13 (Android 13). More evolution than revolution but seems to work fine.There is no perfect phone, the best you can do is wade through the reviews and go for what does what you want the best. For me that's camera performance and I'm not disappointed. Definitely worth considering.

The build quality is generally amazing. The ColourOS software pack has taken a little bit to get used to, but isn't horrid.The camera is just incredobly good.Al in all, anyone with an older phone will be blown away by the X5. And with the free Oppo Pad Air promotion at my time if buying (sold for £130), I paid only £400 for this brand new device. No regrets.

Now this Oppo Find X5 5g is doing the same thing as the oneplus phones where as it is disconnecting every phone call at 29 minutes and 50 seconds. These two types of phones have the same parent company and share very similar softwhere, whether it is a oppo/oneplus glitch or a Google 12 glitch I don't know, but hopefully this will be fixed with a future softwhere update.It's dissapointing to know that my new phone is not perfect.

The screen is very clear and the colours are nice and colourful. The phone can charge from 0 to 100% in about 45 minutes. I think the black phone colour is possibly the best. Compared with the Oppo Find X2 Pro this seems better in various ways, because although I tried the Oppo Find X2 and liked it, I had a problem because the phone connected to weak wi-fi signals even though I had adjusted the settings, which was a big problem in London. Oppo seems to have corrected the problem with this phone.The camera is great and the colours of the photos are vibrant and sharp. The fingerprint reader works well also. I bought the phone in the offer period and I got a free smart-watch, an air charger and a new case as a 'Gift Pack'. The only trouble is that there is no Oppo mail app on the phone, I cannot understand why that hasn't been included, so I will have to try to find a way of downloading one.

This is our 5th Oppo and they have always been stable,reliable and perform well too.Despite being released 2yrs ago this phone is still very current and worthy of being called a flagship phone and at just over £400 it is excellent value for money and in my opinion will match any current £1000 phone. The screen is of amazing quality, its a fast phone well made and comes with  charger, headphones and very nice case too. Color OS runs well with no bloatware and mine has updated to Android 13 and according to Oppo is on the list for Android 14 too so the phone remains fully upto date. Rumours are that Oppo may sadly pull out of Europe market due to the usual political issues so get one while you can you won't be disappointed.

A few hours of tweaking and it's barely any difference to iOS now.There a few minor annoying bugs, for example my wallpaper is resetting once every few weeks, which then also changes the theme colours. The player controls for Apple music appear on the cover screen even after the app is closed, even after a restart.

That was a reason for choosing this to replace a Xiaomi. It is a good weight and size and sits comfortably in the hand, has reasonable memory and the processor seems up to quite heavy demands of a smartphone (I was a bit doubtful of a Mediatek processor - I've previously gone for Qalcomm but this outperforms the Qualcomm in the previous Xiaomi. I don't use it for gaming, but just about everything else). The camera is pretty good, but the promise of 48 mp or more for the camera overlooks the fact that the small lens on this (and probably any) smartphone is not up to providing the definition to benefit much from extra megapixels. (For seriously better photo quality get a good digital camera.) Interestingly it does a better job of picking up a fairly poor 4g phone signal from O2 where I live. I did wonder about the facial recognition but it is quite neat. The on-screen fingerprint reader is ok but can misread on the first attempt sometimes. It has a pin login but sadly does not have a pattern login, which I miss. But it does have a lovely 3.5mm stereo jack for wired headphones.

I've loved it since I got it and it can do so much more than any device that I've ever owned, or need.I've often dropped it or left it at the bottom of my handbag, being bumped by all the other stuff I chuck in there. But still it's going strong and in great condition after 19 months of daily use. Despite the fact that approx 6 months ago I broke the screensaver that had been on it since I brought it and I haven't bothered to replace it - the screen is still in great condition with only some very minor scratches.I'm currently looking - casually - for a replacement for this phone - only because I take a lot of pictures and videos of my family, accumulate a lot of junk and I'm starting to edge closer to the huge 128gb storage on this device. Perhaps I should concentrate on getting rid of some of that junk first before 'upgrading' - since this phone competently does everything I need it it to do, as well as so much more. Easily the best phone I've ever owned.

OnePlus 8T
 when it was reduced to £399 recently only to realise that OnePlus still hasn’t fixed their ‘no 5G on our expensive 5G phones’ problem yet, it was nice to see this £300 Oppo picking 5G signal.It’s also worth mentioning that this is my first MediaTek chipset phone, all my previous phones have been running on Snapdragon chipsets and I was a bit hesitant before buying it, but if you’re thinking the same? There’s no need to hesitate, MediaTek preforms just as well as Snapdragon.Start up and initial set up was smooth, apart from one step that took a bit longer than usual, but it did move forward and I was asked to finish setting my ‘Reno5 z’ up, clearly a cloned software from another OPPO device, but it worked.Within a few minutes, a software update was picked up and it updated to latest Android security updates and everything ran smoothly.Startup time with all my apps downloaded and fully logged onto is about 2/3 seconds slower than the OnePlus 8T, which I think is a great achievement from a £300 handset.I can go on forever but I’ll try to list what I believe to be the pros and cons of this handset:Pros:1- 5G that actually works.2- Screen is vibrant and clear, dim enough in the dark and bright enough under Sun light.3- Screen is super bright and responsive, but not the power hungry 120Hz screen.4- Fingerprint scanner is incredibly responsive, and much better than conventional rear or side mounted physical sensors.5- Battery life is amazing, 2 days moderate/heavy use without needing to recharge it.6- Customisation is almost endless, and fun.7- Thin and lightweight.8- 3.5 mm headphone jack.Cons:1- Camera isn’t great on Ultra Wide mode, and struggles a bit on low light, but I think this can be rectified on future software updates as the sensor itself is a decent snapper.2- Menu can be a bit childish, and things like text size and screen zoom can jump from one extreme to the other, a sliding option can be handy.3- At first, I couldn’t enable pattern unlock instead of password, but finally found it by trying to change password.4- Always On Display stays at full brightness for too long, might be too bright during night time.5- Disabling icon names extends to drawer icons too, not just desktop icons.6- No VoWifi or VoLTE on Tesco Mobile.7- Can not disable swiping left from home screen to access Google news feed, it’s just there whether you like it or not. Also can not disable any of Google apps.As you can see, most of the cons are software related that I think can easily be rectified by a software update, hopefully Oppo might listen to this and sort it out.The only real competitor for this handset in my eyes (AMOLED Display and under display fingerprint scanner) at the time of reviewing is the 
 realme 8 Pro
 Which has a 108 MP camera, charges at 50W and selling at £259, (But not a 5G handset, so you decide what’s more important). realme is advertising a 5G version of the 8 Pro at the moment however, but no price yet.Overall: I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a decent 5G phone to pick this up, you will probably be wondering why other phones cost twice the price or even more.

As an avid tech enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Oppo A54 5G, and I must say, it impressed me in more ways than one.Design and Build:The Oppo A54 5G boasts an elegant and modern design that catches the eye with its sleek lines and glossy finish. The 6.5-inch IPS LCD display stretches from edge to edge, delivering crisp visuals and vibrant colors. The phone feels comfortable to hold, thanks to its slim profile and lightweight construction. The power and volume buttons are conveniently placed, and the fingerprint sensor on the side ensures quick and secure access to the device.Performance:Equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G chipset, the Oppo A54 5G offers a commendable performance for its price range. Everyday tasks like web browsing, social media usage, and multitasking are handled smoothly. Even graphics-intensive games run fairly well, though there may be occasional stutters on higher graphics settings. The 6GB of RAM provides decent multitasking capabilities, and the 128GB of internal storage offers ample space for apps, media, and files. Additionally, the phone's 5G connectivity ensures faster download and upload speeds in supported areas, future-proofing it for evolving networks.Camera:The camera setup on the Oppo A54 5G is surprisingly competent, given its mid-range status. The quad-camera array features a 48MP primary lens, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and two 2MP macro and depth sensors. In well-lit conditions, the primary camera captures detailed and vibrant images. The ultra-wide lens is perfect for scenic shots, but the quality drops slightly in low-light scenarios. The macro lens, while fun to use, lacks the sharpness of the primary camera. The 16MP front-facing camera delivers decent selfies, though beautification features can sometimes oversaturate the images.Battery Life:One of the standout features of the Oppo A54 5G is its impressive battery life. The 5,000mAh battery easily powers the phone through a full day of moderate to heavy usage. Even with extensive app usage, video streaming, and gaming, I found the phone lasting well into the evening without needing a recharge. The phone also supports 18W fast charging, allowing you to get back to full power relatively quickly.Software:The Oppo A54 5G runs on ColorOS, which is based on Android. The user interface is clean, intuitive, and offers a host of customization options. However, some may find the pre-installed bloatware a bit intrusive, but they can be removed or disabled to some extent.Conclusion:The Oppo A54 5G offers exceptional value for money, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for a 5G-capable smartphone. Its sleek design, commendable performance, versatile camera setup, outstanding battery life, and 5G support make it a reliable daily driver. While it may not compete with higher-end flagships, it outperforms most devices in its price segment. If you're in the market for a mid-range smartphone with 5G capabilities, the Oppo A54 5G should be high on your list.

My previous phone was an iPhone X and I wanted a cheaper replacement.Pros:- Looks excellent (both screen and hardware), I chose the grey/black gradient style- Prompts to update to Android 13 (latest version of Android at the time of writing) it does each version in turn, allow some spare time for this- Includes a free gel case and screenprotector pre-fitted- Fast facial recognition and fingerprint reader conveniently integrated into the power button- Very good price- Camera floating in the corner looks better than the notch style- Performance is good if you are not multi-tasking apps- ColorOS looks good and does not feel a step down compared to iOS- Camera is pretty good for casual use- Was able to run C&C Rivals game pretty well- Amazing battery lifeCons- Sometimes when you switch between apps it forgets where it was in the other app and the app reloads. Not sure if this is the phone, the app or Android but just flagging this happens when it didn't on my iPhone X. Not a big problem, but if you had written a lot of text in one app make sure you save or copy it before switching apps just in case. If you are doing some critical multi-tasking and need ultra high performance I would spend more.- In C&C Rivals the game feels like it could be a bit smoother compared to iPhone X so I would spend a bit more next time.Amazing what you can get for the money now. I wouldn't go back to Apple now.

It fits into the recently made mid range flagship category, going up against the OnePlus Nord and the Pixel 4A.The phone arrived ontime in a beautiful case with an 18W VOOC Charger, earphones, a sim ejector tool, a plastic case and some documentation. It arrives with a pre-applied screen protector that is also a fingerprint magnet.First impressions, INCREDIBLE PHONE.The 4000mah battery can last 6-7 hours screen on time so easily 3 days with low usage. This is a full day phone. The 18W charger can go to full in 1.5 hours while the  65W charger available from OPPO can do 30 minutes, so the battery is great.The camera: this phone comes with a 48MP Sony sensor on the back and a nice 16MP front camera with a bokeh lens as well. The pill shaped cutout easily blends in with the phone and is much better than the now dated notch. Both cameras take great shots that perfectly capture the scene however it does not feature Optical Image Stabilisation which consequently requires a bit more effort to take a crystal clear shot.This phone comes with a headphone jack, a rare amenity rarely seen in phones now. It uses USB Type-C and has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which is much better than the cheap, slow in-screen fingerprint scanners shown in other phones. This, paired with the lightning fast Face-ID can almost make the lock screen disappear, they're that fast.The new ColorOS experience gives the phone a premium feel, the gestures and tiny little convenience tools that can transform your experience into one of minimal effort. The phone feels no stuttering, partly thanks to the 8GB of RAM, and while testing on COD: Mobile I recieved 60FPS on medium settings. A good gaming phone as well.Summary: The Oppo Reno 4Z is an excellent phone, with a stunning design, great battery and experience, and excellent build quality. This is a flagship phone. Better than the Pixel 4A, OnePlus Nord, Poco X3 NFC, Realme X50 5GaPROS -- Headphone Jack- 65W SuperVOOC charging- Great battery life- Great cameras- Instant unlock- Great software- Android 10CONS -- No expandable storage- No wireless charging

They are LCD and usually not great quality, I'd much prefer a 60hz good quality OLED anyday. The display is big and crisp, and can get pretty bright but the quality of the colours isnt great.The cameras are okay, again don't be fooled by 48mp, as any photographer will tell you it's not all about the amount of mp. The main centre is passable, ultrawide is usable if you really need it but id stick with the main sensor for optimal results. The other sensors are just fillers, you will never really use them.Performance is actually a big strong point, i didn't notice any stutters or lag in general day to day use, gaming is possible if you lower your quality levels. No complaints here for the price.Fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable, also in a great place.Battery life is great, another big strong point of this phone. Easily get a full days use, even if you game and watch videos.All in all it's a solid phone for the price. I think they could of got away with making the screen a little smaller and using 60hz OLED to really win over the market, but solid purchase really.

This Oppo phone comes with an invisible screen protector already applied which is a very nice touch, and a week into using the phone in the wallet case, it still looks pristine. I had never heard of Oppo before, so did a bit of research and very pleased I did. Apparently they are huge elsewhere and there are plenty of reviews to do some research.Managed to get this when priced at £349.99, before it went back up to £399.00 so feel fortunate I got it then. Apparently previously £699, so pricing seems a bit all over the place, and the product naming is a bit confusing.This is a really great looking 2 SIM card phone that does everything you could ask of it, and does it well.Really beautiful, responsive and large display, very fast charging, excellent cameras.The Oppo clone phone app easily transferred all my apps, contacts and data from the old phone to the new phone without any problems, just a little bit of tidying up, which is to be expected, and relogging in again to the banking apps etc.Came with Android 10, and straight away updated without a problem to Android 11 & Color 11 (Oppos Android skin), so now fully up to date.I am with BT Mobile (EE), and this works brilliantly on the EE network, with 5G service where available. Logs on straight away to my BT router at home to give WiFi calling, so I suppose my Femto signal booster (we live in rural Lincolnshire) is becoming pretty much redundant.Battery life and especially the fast charging is excellent. Charges from 30 % to 100 % in 20 minutes with the supplied 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 mains charger. 256GB of internal storage, so no need for additional memory cards. (no expansion slot anyway)Oppo are great for quality, performance and value, and thinking of buying another one for my partner.

Solution was to buy a midrange outright and get a good contract on data for a relatively affordable price.With slight trepidation, I chose oppo Reno 4 5G as reviews were good (and fairly consistent) from consumers and trusted tech reviews (like gsmarena). Also, EE sell some oppo phones which was a vote of confidence in my mind that their phones must be of reasonable quality.Bearing in mind I'm coming from premium flagship phones in the past, here's what I'm impressed with: Smooth and intuitive U.I , bright screen with good resolution and 90hz refresh rate, fast responsive fingerprint scanner, good battery life (will last all day at normal use), amazing charging speed (approx 30% in 10min), very capable camera for daytime photos and surprisingly good low light photos if you use night mode or manual settings (not Huawei p30 pro level but miles beyond Samsung s8 plus, if that's helpful).I should mention that the Bluetooth 5 gives a very stable connections and it supports hi Res codecs like aptx hd and ldac. I was impressed with the quality of sound from some of my speakers and headphones compared to Huawei. Dolby Atmos sounds more refined for some reason, compared to any phone I've had in the past.All other aspects work well, WiFi and data connection,  phone calls sound fine, build quality is quite premium.Overall, if you can't afford a premium phone then this is a great option. Really, in many respects this is almost premium. Certainly it's brilliant value for money and so far I have no regrets in buying this phone.I've had this for almost 3 months so any issues that crop up after using a device usually do so by now. I will update this review if any change in my opinion but as it is now, I'm well impressed and satisfied with the oppo Reno 4 5G.

For the price I paid, it's extremely good value for having a phone with 12GB Ram, 256GB storage and a (to my eyes) top range screen. The only let down is the 765G processor, but I can't complain really. Comparing it to a the Huawei P30 Pro top end flagship phone I had prior since 2019, the Reno 4 Pro is (how?) still fractionally slower to doing everything, from launching apps, wifi download throughput, the whole lot. It does have 5G though! Not sure where the extra 4GB of RAM has gone, but it's not like you need to wait for it to do things, just that the P30 P was still faster, despite being older, almost full on storage, and using an 'released earlier' but probably superior Kirin 980 processor (both are same generation 7nm). The camera on this phone is decent, but still not up to P30 P standards. However I do feel that the screen on the Reno is superior, at least looking at them side to side the Reno colours seems to 'pop' more' Battery life, it's ok, should last you the day if you are medium user, maybe even 2 if you are light user but I have the feeling I may need to charge it more frequently that my previous phone. On the plus side, it can charge quicker, and as it's lighter. For the price I got it for, a massive bargain, would not hesistate twice if I had to buy it again. Had I have to pay a price that was £50 or £100 more than what I paid, I would look elsewhere.

However, the Customer Service lady was excellent and communicated clearly and her patience was amazing. I ended up returning the phone and will look at getting an Iphone on a monthly plan. Couldnt leave a seller review as no option so have included it in this review. 5 star  for the seller
