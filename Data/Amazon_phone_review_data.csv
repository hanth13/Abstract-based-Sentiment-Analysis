Apple,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (256 GB) - Black Titanium,"1,069",Really happy,"Upgraded from an iPhone 13 Pro Max. Normally get a contract but thought I’d just buy the phone off Amazon and then get a 12 month contract. Works great and really good camera. No faults at all.Taken a while to be delivered as I think the first one got stolen in an Amazon depot

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (256 GB) - Black Titanium,"1,069","IMO, the best premium mobile phone by far...","I'n a huge Apple fan with numerous Apple devices in the house; but a huge fan of Android too (Google Pixel 4XL still and recently a Pixel Fold).My main driver will always be an iPhone due to having the AWU also; but now that 15PM is on USB C it means if I need a cable to charge, I've a plethora of them. No idea where my lightning cables are...!The device in its new titanium finish is superb (I've gone for blue and glad I did over black or 'natural'); the camera / picture quality is superb and overall it's fast, slick and the battery life is excellent alsoI sold my 14PM for £900 on eBay; this cost me a few £hundred to upgrade. Well worth it...

 Maybe i shouldn't say this here,but Samsung it is ""my heart"" and nr 1 for me.I am not an apple user and not a big fun of it.Since iphone 14 Pro Max apple has start to take my attention about design.With the relase of iphone 15 Pro Max,apple""catch""me with a more impressed design and a ""luxury""phone provided withe the titanium frame.Bit more thiny than 14pm,eazy to hold and good grip,no finger prints.Whats confuse me and makes me difficult to understand both phone14pm and 15pm have same screen,but the 15pm will leave the impression that it is a bit smaller than his brothet14pm.The price?well..for 1T.=£1599...it is up to me....a bit  expensive but i need it.Camera?hmmm...not very well impressed,but from 1 to 10 i give 8.I still have to discover many things on it.Battery?looks good...standard use can last 3 even 4days in my case...just using as a phone for sms and calls.With intense use can last 24h without problem(i tested)Medium use,last for me 2 full days and on 2nd day around 11:20pm it was stil 32% battery.

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (256 GB) - Black Titanium,"1,069",The screen freezes and I charge the battery every day.,"I bought an IPhone 15 pro max in December. The phone after 1 month started with different problems, the battery durability is just one day and I need charge every day, the screen sometimes its freezes and the unique solution is return the phone, but I asking about the guarantee, where is the guarantee? Because in my case I need a phone, just I want the replacement because the phone started with different problems. Sincerely I am so disappointed with Amazon and this service, if you can’t give to Apple customers great service, please don’t seller products from Apple. I will go to an official Apple Store and send the phone to they see everything for me. Because Amazon only accept the return to give a refund. They don’t have Iphones to replacement and the client in this case is a complete idiot.Update: Firstly, after many times contacting Amazon I tried to return the product, but they classified it as non-returnable. Why? I don’t know because the window return was to 31 January and I tried return before its day.Secondly, I went to the Apple Store and a technician saw everything on the phone. The phone camera has an internal issue, and the phone has problem with battery, and screen frezes too. Sometimes half screen is in black, sometimes freezes. Now I have a phone that doesn't work correctly and Amazon customer service doesn't want to accept the return or a replacement. Honestly this is so crazy because I bought it with many illusion and now that’s the great support that Amazon gives for me. Of course I will look about my rights because I will not be with a factory defected phone.Thirdly, I have an email from Apple Store, where they say exactly issues the phone has. I want a simple replacement or return this product. I don’t understand why is it so complicating and frustrating for me.

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 (128 GB) - Black,,A tough call - do I really love it?,"A trade up from my trusty iPhone 6S (which was becoming less trusty by the day, suffering from a rapidly depleted battery after very little daily use). First impressions of the iPhone 15 - by comparison, a bland, uninteresting design in an uninspiring choice of colours. I'm getting used to the face recognition, which seems very efficient, even in low light, but I find less universally adopted by some of the apps I use, compared to touch ID. Battery life is excellent - with my conservative use, I find I can go three or four days between charges.  I was impressed by how easy it was to transfer the settings etc. from my old 'phone to the new one - I was up and running in very little time. Probably the most significant improvements over its immediate predecessor are in the area of capturing pictures - something I tend to do with a camera, being a bit old-school (I really should try to get with the programme!). There's no socket for a headphone jack, so I've been obliged to purchase a modestly priced pair of Bluetooth earbuds and I find they work very well with streamed music. Image quality is good - as you'd expect - and the phone has the capacity to do a great deal more than I will ever ask of it. For someone who will make extensive use of its features, the iPhone 15 probably represents great value for money; for me, probably less so.

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 (128 GB) - Black,,A good upgrade on my iPhone X,"It’s the latest iPhone & the old one was getting long in the tooth & the battery failing. Transferring data etc from the old phone to the new one was simple & I was up and running after about 10 minutes. The phone is a lot quicker & runs the latest software. It’s an iPhone so what is there to dislike. As you probably guessed I am an Apple fan, so somewhat biased.  But it syncs with my iMac and my iPad Air ( now 6 years old & next for replacement) and everything works smoothly.

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 (128 GB) - Black,,Bluetooth not working,"Be aware that Bluetooth does not work reliably or at all, on these phones. I got mine through the Amazon Apple Store.  Apple is not advertising the fact, of course, and so I’m not sure if this is a software or hardware problem. I have tried a range of Bluetooth periferals that worked fine with older iPhone models.  It won’t even find many of them and when it does say that it is connected, it clearly is not paired.  The only 'solutions' being offered are turning a long list of things off and on in the hope that this will somehow help. It has’nt.The battery seems to need charging more often than I would have anticipated on a new phone and gestures also seem  flaky. My advice would be to try before you buy or skip upgrading.  I wish I hsd.

Apple,Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Midnight,479,A step ahead of the game.,"Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Apple,Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Midnight,479,Absolute bargain,"Used the XS Max not long after it launched, and can say without hesitation at if you have a 11 or older this phone is a massive upgrade.Definitely get the higher storage. It’s just a plus, went for the 256gb & this phone has literally last me full days with 5-8 hours of daily usage with about 15-23% battery left. Not using power mode yet, and usually not n medium-to-low brightness as well & it still gets through using apps like snap,insta, drive, maps & others. Even playing games like Diablo immortal & Simpsons tapped out.Camera is an absolute must, although in-doors it seems to lack to older models. It really relies on more light even in basic settings.Sound, screen, pixels, everything is gorgeous. The size is noticeable if you come from any pro or max, but for the price, reliability, and quality it isn’t that bad.

Apple,Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Midnight,479,Forget worries about battery life or weird online reviews,"I bought this on EMI payments as my old iPhone 5S recently packed up whilst I was involved in the purchase of a house. I needed to spread the cost but also have the full facility of a phone without having to negotiate credit cards, which I didn't want to get into, or pay massive upfront costs. For sixty quid a month (plus my tiny GiffGaff sim) I have a new phone, which will be all paid in a year. I also got 2T of iCould storage and an external generic hard drive for my old Mac around the same time for about 25 quid. This meant I could 'start again' with my Mac, and the endless photos from my travels could be stored safely while I save up for a new Macbook. Meanwhile, this phone has double the storage of my old Macbook. Unlike my old phone, it can perform admin tasks when I'm in quiet moments at work, such as applying for jobs. I'm not meaning to explain phones, it's just that for me new tech isn't renewed that often and I had to justify the expense to myself. This phone has already proved itself over the last month. The camera is much better than my old phone, but not quite as flashy as the most recent iPhone. I couldn't justify an extra 300 quid for a camera, regardless of my professional art needs, that wouldn't really meet my landscape photography needs. You still can't fit a mirror inside an iPhone in order to make it perform as well as an SLR. it's jus tnot physically possible yet to lose that terrible over-size foreground emphasis you get inmost smartphone pics. But for reference photos, portrait photography with friends, and general snaps this camera is good. I have an SLR I will use for landscapes instead, and may upgrade. The joy of a new phone is being able to listen to all the music you couldn't store on the old one, being able to perform complex functions a less powerful phone can't deal with, and also being able to indulge all your interests/needs in one place without worrying about space. I prioritised my phone upgrade before my Macbook upgrade for precisely this reason. If you have to choose between which one to upgrade, I'd go with the phone as you can always get cables to link your phone to a projector or tv screen if you're a student or trying to cut costs in the current economy. I'm amazed at how much I can watch on my unlimited data plan - the only risk is becoming a bit of an internet-addict too quickly. I love a new app called Metronaut too, so useful for musicians, and it's a relief to be able to indule my passions wihtout fear of freeze or collapse. Whenever I have had problems with this, it just requires a switch-off/switch-on - it's usually as I've had too much activity on my phone (for like, hours) or I just haven't closed pages. I""m impressed with the low-light picture-taking too - I can instantly update photos to Insta even in difficult light conditions. It means a better-documented moment-to-moment sense of of the World, and memories get stored, isntead of lost in storage collapse and frustration.

Apple,Apple iPhone 14 (128 GB) - Midnight,579,So far so good,"Fairly easy to migrate my apps from android to this iPhone 14, still had to install and faff about with my banking apps but no big deal.Had to re set up authenticator apps again which took a little time but then again you would expect that going from one OS to another.As I signed in to this phone with a different email I initially lost my iTunes link but after some investigating all you need to do is click settings, your name, and click on media & purchases and change the email / password in that to the same one as you use for iTunes and next time you open the iTunes app your songs etc should be on there.Anyway, onto the phone itself.Screen is a bit smaller than I am used to but not by much, phone feels quality and apps work speedily compared to my old android.What I like about the iPhone OS is that it is simple and quick to navigate and with face recognition there are no issues with greasy thumbs / fingers not being read and again quick to open.Battery life is good, but it still needs to be charged at the end of the day with the way I use it.Charging takes a little longer than my old phone but not too much of an issue.Camera although not as powerful as my old one actually takes clearer / sharper images.Overall quite happy with this

Apple,Apple iPhone 15 Plus (128 GB) - Black,769,The sweet spot in the current lineup,"Finally rid of the notch and lightning connection. The reason I purchased this.Nicely boxed with tamper sealingComplete with a Braided usb-c lead accessory which is cool.Has the usual sim pin included in the UK.I wish the telecoms market would get their act together on eSIM.Colour, I had intended to get boring black but I chose a pastel Matt Green with the glossy apple logo to the rear. Chosen more due to the fact that the other colours had sold out but I actually like it now I’ve got it and its colour is concealed in my OtterBox Strada case anyway.On opening, the first thing you will notice is how lightweight the phone is and in my position only weighed down by the case weight.You will notice the dual cameras are very pronounced and the phone doesn’t lay flat on a surface.My case offers excellent protection for the lenses and allows it to lay flush.The iPhone has an aluminium casing with lovely rounded edges.Set up for my experience. This was the painful part.Transferring data from my iPhone 11 was not the easiest of tasks and I had to take an update to the fifteen before it would initiate the transfer process.However Once completed my new phone was near identical in appearance and usability apart from one or two apps that required setting up again.The Home Screen is large, bright and colourful is blessed with something called the Dynamic island which alters its size and shape dependent on the app that requires it.This is a great feature introduced to recent Apple phones and transforms the viewing experience when watching content playback of the likes  of Prime, Netflix, Disney etc.It is finally a really enjoyable viewing experience now the dreaded notch has gone.Some have mentioned a lower refresh rate on this model compared to the Pro models but is not a noticeable problem for me.Not just watching but the Sound quality even at low volumes is brilliant particularly when watching movies.Watch Blade Runner 2049 or rather listen to it on the Apple app is a totally immersive experience even without AirPods.Officer K’s visit to the Wallace Corporation’s Earth Headquarters has great depth and echo as he exchanges dialogue with the file clerk and Luv in its large halls.iOS 17 standby mode is slightly disappointing down to the exclusivity of the pro models only having an always on display. But this is the only real disappointment of this model.The ability to plug in USB devices and exchange data or charge or receive power from other devices is a real step forward.Battery life is phenomenal. End of!Doesn’t get hot when charging and lasts ages. Unless you have got it glued to your face you can expect a couple of days between charges for average use and when the battery is new of course.I have some older wireless chargers that are struggling a bit to charge through the mag safe case with the phone attached.This hasn’t been an issue before with my other phones. I haven’t got a new type mag safe charger yet and is not really a phone issueThe camera has several new features including automatically picking out portraits without specifically switching to portrait mode.It has a up to 48 mega pixel camera and with iOS 17 can produce bokeh effect portraits.There are some brilliant video modes including a live action sports type mode.4K or HD recording and frame rate adjustment.

Looks awesome, lightening fast and is just a dream to use.I like bigger phones and this is perfect for all my media and communication needs.

I was not impressed with the cable that came with it, when I removed it from my plug the cover of the usb came off in my hands, so threw that straight in the bin and I ordered a set of 2 x fast charging plugs with the cables.

After much nagging from everybody I decided to purchase my first iPhone but they were ridiculously expensive so I decided to try a refurbished one. The first one that I had was the iPhone SE but there was a problem with that so it had to go back. I also realised that the phone was actually too small and I didn’t really think that I was getting all the benefits that I would with an iPhone. Therefore I paid a bit more and got this one and I am so glad I did.The phone was in excellent condition with no marks or scratches. It came boxed p, but not in the original iPhone box and it had a charger which was not a genuine Apple one but there’s not been any problems using it. I have had an iPad for a number of years, so I found the interface easy to work with. I love the fact that my photos, emails etc are shared between the two as it makes life so much easier.I think that iPhones, whether they are refurbished or new, are ridiculously overpriced so I am gong have to take a star off for that, but, apart from that, I have been very impressed by this iPhone and if money is an issue I think buying refurbished is definitely the way to go. My bad experience did not put me off and I am very glad it did not, as this one is really good,

Apple,Apple 2022 iPhone SE (64 GB) - Midnight,379,Really good but not trendy,"I bought this cell phone having tried an iPhone XR (for about 6 months) never got on with it. I found the XR's virtual buttons really irritating and eventually went back to my previous iPhone 7. I liked having the physical control of a home button. There was nothing much wrong with my iPhone 7, but it was getting a bit old, so I decided to replace it.My 17 year old son jokes that 'SE' stands for 'Senile & Elderly' - and there may be something in that. The cell phone was exactly the same form as my iPhone 7 (I thought the case and screen protector would probably have fitted), but is more modern internals. It doesn't have facial recognition (good) but does have fingerprint control on the home button. There is nothing not to like on this cell phone for an old fogey like me.After a hiccup with the first parcel (Amazon lost it in transit) a replacement turned up on time. The iPhone SE largely set itself up from my iPhone 7's iCloud backup file and was ready to use in about half an hour. It is just like the iPhone 7 in every way, except it is a bit faster, has a better camera and battery life.

Apple,Apple 2022 iPhone SE (64 GB) - Midnight,379,5G,"I have been a fan of the SE range since Apple started to make them. I am not a fan of social media and I am old fashioned enough to actually like using a camera for taking photo’s ( yep iam a bit of a dinosaur), so I don’t need 3 cameras on my phone or a large screen to watch memes or videos on. The last model I had was the 2020 SE which has lasted well, it still has a 88% battery capacity after fairly heavy use and the battery still lasts a whole day without needing a top up  ( bought on day of release). TBH I would still be using it but I wanted a phone capable of a 5G connection as I get 5G for not extra cost on my sim. The SE range has a decent chip running things behind the scenes and I use mostly cloud storage so the 64GB Ram is more the enough for my needs. The phone is compact, I don’t know why people want to carry around these huge 6.7 inch phones that stick out of their pockets 🤣.  At 4.7 inch this is big enough for me. So if you want a decent phone and your not into SM, watching movies etc and making epic features on your phone this is a very sleek, well constructed phone. I would recommend a cover as it can be a little slippery when handling and you wouldn’t want to drop it!! I just hope Apple continues to make the range as I hear they might be dropping this type of model but who knows what the future holds with Apple.

Apple,Apple 2022 iPhone SE (64 GB) - Midnight,379,A small powerhouse,"The iPhone SE (2022) is a phone that straddles the future and the past. The A15 Bionic chip inside this phone delivers flagship power for hundreds less than the iPhone 13. And the image quality is mostly excellent despite being limited to a single rear camera. I just wish Apple found a way to include a proper Night mode. And yet the design of the new iPhone SE looks like a throwback with its small 4.7-inch display and huge bezels around the display… Overall, the iPhone SE (2022) mostly succeeds in terms of providing a great value. But next time I'd like to see a design that better matches the cutting edge vibe of the internals.

Apple,Apple 2022 iPhone SE (64 GB) - Midnight,379,Great little iPhone with TouchID,"I am so grateful for the new SE; even though the design has not changed or gotten a bigger screen, I despise the FaceID and could not be happier to get an updated phone with TouchID instead. Battery life is very decent, the phone is fast, the screen and cameras are great, too.When getting this phone, mind most of the old screen protectors might not fit as the edges are slightly curved and the full front protectors would not stick well around the edges - I got my screen protector from MediaDevil, who adjusted the protectors to be shorter and protect your screen well. To cover the edges, get a case that reaches the front :)One downside of buying this device off of Amazon was that they dispatched it via DPD and we have been victims of the false “attempted delivery” where nobody showed. If you can, choose to have the order delivered to a pickup point.

Apple,Apple 2022 iPhone SE (64 GB) - Midnight,379,Home button doesn't work in gloves,"Home button is in touch screen technology. Works the same way as the rest of the screen. In fact, it it only a dedicated part of the screen rather than a physical button. Thus, can't be used with nails or hands in gloves. I know that it is not a major problem, but Iphone X with swipe home function at least provides the extra square inch of screen size.The only advantage is that the fingerprint reader works very well, much faster than older SE. So when you press home button with your finger it also activates the phone.If anyone wonders what my problem is: the SE first generation I used to keep on a table, whenever time or notification was about to be checked, I simply pressed the home button. I could use gloved hand or any object to physically press the button. With the new SE, i must remove glove or use side button which is not easy as the volume button is exactly paralel position. So whenever I squeeze phone both buttons gets activated.I think its gonna be my last SE, as useful home button was the only advantage over the mainstream Iphones.

Apple,"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Purple (Renewed)",183,Thank goodness for Amazon,"So I purchased a repurposed I-phone 11, advertised as being “excellent” from Stovk must go.When it arrived it was missing a charger which was included in the description, but more importantly did not comply with the description for excellent condition.  I never set the phone up so cannot comment upon performance or battery life.  The screen not only had many superficial grazing type scratching, but had 3 major scratches that not only could be seen but could be felt.  How this was not spotted when the phone was comprehensively checked raises questions doesn’t it.At first I thought there was a good customer service as I very quickly got sent prepaid return labels.  The phone was sent back and I sent them a copy of the receipt which had the return number on it.  I checked it had been delivered and messaged them.  Despite being in the same audit trail they asked for the return number.  After repeating the info I then got sent a message saying that it would take 48hrs to process the return.  Just how many returns do they get ???!!!I left it 48 hours and then got back in touch.  I was then told the return dept had sent a replacement.  This was despite asking for a refund as the replacement would not have arrived in time.  To make things worse, we were away so a relative went around to retrieve it fro the doorstep.When I got back I had to print off yet another label and send it back (didn’t even open as I had had to purchase a replacement).  Again I sent copies of the receipts with a new return number.  Again when the parcel had been received I contacted them again, and again was told I needed to wait a further 48hrs ( guess lots of other people had been sent unacceptable phones !)  I did state that it was unfair my refund was delayed due to their errors, but to no avail.  I asked that they contacted their returns dept to ensure yet another one was sent.  After another 48 hours I checked again.  I got a standard response and was told to be patient.I wasn’t, so I contacted Amazon.  Within 5 mins they had sorted the issue and arranged for a refund.Thank you Amazon !

Apple,"Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB, Graphite - (Renewed)",306,"Essentially Perfect, For What it's Worth","Aside from a few nitpicks which I'll refer to in this post, the phone I received is pretty much exactly as is detailed in the product description.Face ID works as expected, and out of the box it has a battery health of 86% (not at all perfect, but for a refurbished phone it's pretty good!), which is essentially as described by seller. Both the front and rear cameras work as expected, and so far produce images and videos just as well as if it were bought new from Apple. As expected, the device came with a charger, though keep in mind that (in line with all Apple products nowadays) these are now often sold as USB-C to Lightning cables, as opposed to USB 3.0. For that reason, make sure you have a port/adapter which takes USB-C cables, or have an existing lightning cable you can use.I'm also pleasantly surprised at how visibly clean the phone is - after reading a few reviews on this page for the ""excellent quality"" version of this refurb, I was expecting to see a few imperfections. Thankfully though, I seem to have gotten lucky. After a few minutes of looking over it, I can't spot a single hairline crack or any points of damage on the edge/back of the phone. Regardless I'd advise caution if this is a concern you have when purchasing, as this has been an uncommon yet known problem with this seller.The only noteworthy issue I have with the product is I sadly didn't receive a pin to open the SIM tray - thankfully I do keep some spare around my house, but had I not, this would've been a pain to sort out. Just in case, I would recommend making sure you have a SIM tray pin/alternative thin metal item, on the off-chance they don't remember to put one in the box for you.As a side point, it's important to be aware that non-Apple approved refurbishment businesses often do not necessarily use OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. While this is noted in this product's description, do keep it in mind. This is *very* rarely a problem as non-OEM parts - in my experience - work just as good as original, but they have been known to cause dilemmas. Things like weaker screen glass, less water resistance, and weaker battery overall. Regardless, if you're buying refurbished these can usually be ignored for the lower price.In conclusion, I'd personally recommend this if you're looking for a cheaper device but still want an iPhone/iOS device. Whether it be for the icloud, Apple's ecosystem, or purely for the feel/user experience, it does its job, and does it well.I hope this review helped you come to a decision on your purchase, whether you bought it or not :).

I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

So I sent it back and they deducted £16.72 when asked why, I was told that was due to the SIM tool not being in the box(it never came with one) and the battery was charged too much?

It should not have been sold as ""excellent"" condition, even though the screen was perfect.Also the battery health was at 81%. While this is just about within their ""at least 80%"" guarantee, I would like it to have been a little higher given the price of this ""renewed"" phone sold in ""excellent"" condition.I contacted Loop to ask for a replacement. They gave me the option of keeping the phone for a £30 refund, or to return it to them (free postage). I returned it. They refunded the money to my card within a couple of days, so I guess they didn't have any iPhone 12 Pros in genuinely excellent condition they could send me.To their credit, their customer service was good.

Apple,"Apple iPhone 11, 128GB, Black (Renewed)",223,Numerous hardware warnings,"Phone arrived well packaged.It was described in the listing as being in “Excellent” condition – no visible marks from 30cm, but upon initial inspection there were visible scuffs and chips on all corners and most of the sides, and also on the back and camera area too, so the 30cm rather depends on your eyesight, doesn’t it?  Mine’s decidedly average and I could see a lot of marks, so the claims are subjective.The screen however was perfect, but more about this in a bit.I powered the phone up and started the migration from my old iPhone SE which has done me well since 2016.  But, part way through this several warnings popped up regarding the hardware on this refurbished iPhone 11.The first was regarding the battery – the phone was saying it was an “Unknown part”.  Then the same warning appeared regarding the display, but more concerning was the next warning that there was an issue with the TrueDepth sensor in the camera, which meant that the camera was now disabled.This is important as Apple got rid of the fingerprint sensor before the iPhone 11, relying on facial recognition (or a PIN) instead for unlocking, and the fact that the TrueDepth sensor is used for the FaceID, this means that FaceID cannot be used to unlock this phone!  That’s a biggie for me and a red flag.The battery issue is also a red flag too as it means, simply, there’s no way to check the status/health of the battery in the phone, so you have absolutely no idea of how good/bad it is.Ok it’s a refurb phone, but these issues are too much for the three-hundred quid it cost.

Apple,"Apple iPhone XR, 64GB, Black - (Renewed)",146,good honest review for the iPhone XR,"I've had this phone for just over 3 weeks, it arrived on the 13th May. I ordered an iPhone XR BLACK 64GB. what I had when I initially opened the packaging ( the packaging is clean, no damage, the phone is super safe and well wrapped ) was a BLUE! iPhone XR. An entirely different color to what I ordered. now normally people would send it back, but I needed a phone and I don't really have the time to send it back, to then be refunded 5-7 business days after they received it to re-purchase in the correct color. it should've been CORRECT the first time around. But even though I hated the color, I decided to just keep it and see if it would grow on me. I still hate it.Now, onto the phone quality:the phone itself had 0 noticeable scratches on it, looked completely brand new, fresh out of an Apple store. for £310, it's worth the amount you save instead of getting one from Apple. The screen has been ""iPhone screen ghosting"" ( search it up on google if you don't understand ) which is very annoying as the only way it fixes itself sometimes, is if you lock the screen then open it again, or leave your phone for a few minutes. In some cases, I've turned the phone off and back on which for the standard they claim there offering, shouldn't happen at all. something must be faulty on the inside for it to be so inconsistent with screen recognition. Finally. the face recognition, mine has worked 85% + of the time. with the exceptions sometimes I might have not had myself in the perfect position for it to recognize me. Not many issues with that but definitely have been a few weird moments where it should've worked and didn't. Don't know if that's down to the technology itself or just the phone refurbishment.Now the final section, the battery lifeUpgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone XR. the difference is crazy, my previous phone would be dead inside a time of 90minutes on low screen brightness and on power mode. but on this phone, the battery life can literally last me all day. as I work from home at my desk, I'm not on it 24/7 so some days I forget to charge it and have enough to use it the next day. I'm not much of a phone person, I probably have 30ish hours of screentime a week which isn't a lot compared to other people my age. having upwards of nearly 100+hours. Battery life is 4.5/5 for me

OnePlus,OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (UK) - 12GB RAM 256GB SIM Free Smartphone with 50MP AI Triple Camera and 80W SUPERVOOC Fast Charging - Grey Shadow [UK version],300,Great phone for the price.,"I bought this phone to replace an aging but well served Nokia 8. I was totally bamboozled by the plethora of internet reviews about the "" best mid priced smartphone"" but had got it down to a choice of two. So I decided to keep to a strict budget. Therefore, based on the price, operating system, features and my simple usage I plumbed for this. The Oneplus Nord 2T.The phone promptly arrived and a lot of it's features, given good words by Amazon customers reviews, were proven to be very accurate.The operating system is Android 12 and the One plus UI overlay is pretty none intrusive over the general order of things. The battery lasted impressively considering the amount of use for installing, configuring and generally setting everything up. I would say I'm an average user and the battery lasted generally 2 days. I think this is good seeing as it is a modern phone and has a lot to do. Charging time was a remarkable step up but I'm of the "" make a brew whilst it's charging"" frame of mind so it's no biggie ( it is fast taking 0 to charged in roughly half an hour).The screen is very good indeed and has loads of settings that I'm still getting used to. The clarity of it struck me most - and contrary to what anyone says - 90Hz refresh rate is fab considering the size of the screen.The camera has loads of settings too but I'm very impressed with what I have seen so far.The phone itself comes with a case, screen protector already fitted and is a very sleek modern design. I opted to buy an extra cover and some tempered glass screen protectors as I know it may come across a set of keys in my pocket!! I particularly like the on screen finger print reader - as it actually works !! I took a tip from a previous reviewer and used my middle finger to set it up, due to cuts and knocks on my index finger and thumb.All in all I would say that if you would like a reasonably cheap phone ( by today's standards) with a load of neat features, dead easy to use, looks and feels great with a nifty bit of camera to boot - then you won't go far wrong with one of these. By the way - don't fuss over lack of IP rating - as you're not that daft to bury it in sand or go swimming with it - are you?!!

OnePlus,OnePlus 12R 5G (UK) 16GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone - 2 Year Warranty - Iron Gray,621,Flagship killer that puts competition to bed,"Absolutely no clue what these people are talking about when they say "" no wireless charging"" or ""USB-C video""...I don't think they themselves know what they're talking about. OnePlus has never claimed the12R has wireless charging and they certainly have never mentioned ""usb c video"" which is not a thing,it doesn't exist in the real world to begin with... anyways...The phone has phenomenal battery life and charging capabilities. It can last you up to 2 days and a half with average use and up to a day with INTENSIVE use. Then,you can charge it from 0% to 100% in 26 minutes! Do you need an ""overnight wireless charging""???The screen is one of the best on the market with variable refresh rate going down to 1 Hz and up to 120 Hz. It gets very bright and you don't have to worry even in the sunniest of days.The main camera is excellent for both day and night photos. The ultrawide camera is good for what it is i.e. it's the best the capabilities of it can give you- 8MP sensor (not exactly a compliment..); the 2MP macro camera is useless as usual...but the good news is the vast majority of people only use the main camera. The Selfie camera is good. No doubt about itIt's got stereo speakers that are very decent in terms of both loudness,clarity and even a little bit of bass.The IP rating is 65 which means full protection of dust and sprays of water from all sides. It ain't a rating to submerge your phone fully in water but it still is good enough for me. Maybe not you...The phone is made of glass front and back and an aluminium frame. Sturdy enough for sure and to last.And last but not least: it has a flagship chipset which:A) is surprisingly power-efficient and helps the batteryB) is blazingly fastC) is gonna last for at least 4 years from nowD) it's got everything needed - speed, reliability, efficiency, 5G, wi-fi 7,the whole shebang...

OnePlus,OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite (UK) 8GB RAM 128GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 108MP Triple Camera - Chromatic Grey [UK version],249,"Stylish, Fantastic phone with a great camera","I've had this phone since the beginning of June and have taken it on holiday.I just needed a reasonable phone for personal use away from work. Had a look through everything and having had one plus flagship phones before thought I'd take a punt on this.Given this is a LCD screen it's very good, could be a bit brighter in full sun though, just enough to get by on a French beach though so ok. The one grumble is the adaptive brightness in dark rooms can be a little low, my other one plus phones suffered this too.Oxygen OS still feels as intuitive as ever and it is without question the best Android experience you can have still. So much of the unfinished feel has been taken away from android and if you're more used to Apple iOS you'll feel a bit more at home here.The camera needs a bit of getting used to but does take awesome shots of you use AI or go to the HD camera option. The AI is very good indeed and managed to pick out the colours and fill the Blanc's in on some very faded tapestries in french château making them look vibrant and lively. The camera detail however wipes the floor with the Samsung note 20 I had previously even if the software isn't as intuitive. It's worthwhile exploring a little more though, and 1+ do often improve camera stability through OTA updates.I chose the pastel lime green which a few people have now complimented on how stylish the phone looks. It's a better thought out than a other phones of this price and looks a bit iPhone inspired.What's missing from your usual one plus feel? The sound on off switch and the very high build quality. This is however a third of the price so you can't grumble really.Overall I'm happy I got this phone and it feels like excellent value. It's far better than most of the tech reviews indicate, and definitely better than the sum total of its parts would suggest.

OnePlus,OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (UK) - 8GB RAM 128GB SIM Free Smartphone with 50MP AI Triple Camera and 80W SUPERVOOC Fast Charging - Jade Fog [UK version],302,Its a flagship phone without the price,"Lets put this into context, I have been part of Samsung's universe since 2016 and in truth it was great, software was smooth, the experience was easy and the phones were all really solid and reliable.So when I was called in to handover my A52 to my son who was limping along with an older Samsung I straightaway went to look for another Samsung but in truth I was only willing to spend circa £400 for an upgrade and the A53 was just like buying the same phone as the A52 so I bravely looked afield and trawled the internet for reviews like a sad sack.Anyway I found that a very trustworthy brit YouTube channel regarded the Nord 2T very highlight I with much trepidation grabbed one from Amazon.Right well it arrived and the finish is superb, an all glass phone (GG5 no less) that has a better camera than the A52 and is pretty seamless to use, in fact it is lightening quick. Superb to use, no lag and very smooth.The handset is still 2020's large but it is both shorter and shallower than the A52 and easy to hold, I can even get it in a pocket.The face recognition is lightening quick, (be careful tho, security is compromised) and the OS is really slick... HOWEVER the OS in my honest view is not quite as smooth as Samsung's, it feels a bit pared back which i guess allows things to move much more quickly combined with a really strong processor so my mate at YouTube seems to say. I have to admit there are bits of the OS that just feel nicer with Samsung but comparing between the brands, this Oxygen OS thingy is just so very quick and like a Pixel so I am told.Fingerprint is miles better than the Samsung I had and I love having a physical switch to turn of notifications, I would have to recommend that you get a case and a screen protector as it will no doubt crack without one. Saying that the range of cases is not great, the Spigen one recommended was poor so I found a nice one from OnePlus themselves which fits perfectly and keeps things small but protected.Look its great, I really am impressed as i came into the Nord 2T with lower expectation but its such a nice phone with a really zippy OS and a great look and feel to the handset that I have to say this was a good move.Usually keep phones for 1 or 2 years so lets see how things go...

Excellent low light and HDR performance.  Average 4k video recording but good full hd.Great system performance, no lag, no heat and very quick.Amazing charging speed, literally increases a percentage every 15 seconds on the vooc charger.Good screen, not the brightest or highest refreshrate, but very high quality 90hz FHDRam Boost, can use some storage to boost the ram from 8gb to 13gb if you wantGreat front facing camera.Excellent 'all day' battery life, getting about 6 hours Screen on time over 15 hours use. Rarely have to charge in the day.Cons -Some bugs which I'm sure OnePlus will fix, but they are quite annoying, for example, sometimes the phone cannot pick up any 4g/5g data,  you have to manually turn off the data and back on.  Also when in a low light environment the selfie cam seems to always default to light up the screen mode, even if you turn it off.  Also sometimes the bluetooth disconnects from my car and needs manually reconnecting.Not major issues but hopefully they are ironed out as it's a fantastic phone.

I paid £299 for the 8GB / 128GB version. I wouldn't pay more for the 12 / 256 as the 8GB is plenty fast.Almost flagship quick processor. A good camera for the price, although I'm comparing it to a pixel 4 where the camera is exceptional, so a little unfair. Good all day battery life and mega quick recharging - 0 to 100% in 30 mins, but you have to use the included charger AND the cable. Colour is grey but with a blue tinge, maybe this is what Sierra means....Screen is lovely to use....don't use the Samsung internet browser, as this isn't compatible with a smooth 90HZ refresh rate that this phone has.Fast and responsive 2D face recognition and fingerprint reader.The glass back feels more like plastic, but I still like it.

OnePlus,OnePlus Nord 2 5G (UK) - 12GB RAM 256GB SIM Free Smartphone with Triple Camera and 65W Warp Charge - Grey Sierra [UK version],469,OnePlus Nord 2 5G - 7 Months Later!,"After running with the Huawei P30 for a year and a half I thought about OnePlus when it next came time to upgrade. I then started to look at their phones and research OxygenOS and liked what I saw.I then discovered the Nord series - midrange handsets with near flagship level features/specs and started investing more time into it. I found out the latest Nord model would release. So after weeks of mulling it over and directly comparing the P30 against the Nord 2 I decided to take the plunge.I took delivery of the phone the next day and set about unboxing and setting it up. I was like a kid at Christmas. The phone came in a nice looking black box with simple blue lines down the side and the OnePlus Nord branding imprinted on the front. When you shine light on the Nord lettering and look from a certain angle you can see a multi-colour reflection.I then unboxed the phone which came with a screen protector preinstalled and a clear rubber case (when you set the phone down on a flat surface with the case on and turn on the torch the entire thing lights up around the edges and looks pretty snazzy) Also included is the 65w charger, red USB-C cable, SIM removal tool, documents and a very nice letter from OnePlus.Holding the phone in my hand without the case, I have to say it feels amazing, it's a really comfy phone to hold and unlike any phone I've held before, because of the materials it's made from. It's kind of hard to explain but it just feels nice in the hand. It's almost like a silky smooth texture with very slight roughness for grip.Anyway, I powered on and set up the phone, logged in with my Google details, ran all the system software updates and installed all my apps. I then went to settings to do some tinkering and customise the OS to a look and feel of my liking. Everything is easy to find in the settings and there's a respectable amount of things to customise for the OS (colours, AOD, fonts, wallpapers, horizon light for notifications etc)As for OxygenOS itself I like it - very fresh, clean and simple. And it'll only get better once 12.0 releases. It's currently 4 April 2022 as I'm writing this and I'm still waiting for 12.0 so hopefully it'll be here soon. A Theme store and more new features will be getting added, as far as I'm aware. Just search OxygenOS 12 to see the new additions.The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset is as good as any on-par Qualcomm Snapdragon and can handle graphic intensive games like COD Mobile with ease - No overheating. No lag. Nothing of the sort that I've noticed. The MediaTek is a solid performing chipset and the glue that holds everything together. Great levels of performance with no noticeable frame drops or dips during gameplay or in general daily usage.As for the refresh rate the Nord 2 might only have 90Hz capability and not the 120Hz of some flagship models but it's obviously better than 60Hz and is pretty much the sweet spot, as battery life would suffer under 120Hz. You can have it in either 90Hz or 60Hz mode but sometimes the phone will switch between modes depending on the scenario. I leave it on 90Hz for the most part and it's fine.The FHD+ Fluid AMOLED display with HDR10+ makes for impressive viewing - sharp looking details, vibrant & true to life colours which pop nicely (you can change vividness in settings) and overall just a nice, big, bright, crystal clear viewing experience - games, TV series, movies and YouTube all look amazing!The 4500mAh battery with 65w charging is a godsend and will get you out of a jam, for example if you're short on time. I've put the Nord 2 on charge at around 15%, gone away then come back about 25 minutes later and it's already at 100%. They weren't lying about the charging speed.Awesome camera, too! Shots with the built-in Sony IMX766 Exmor sensor look sharp with nice accurate colour and detail, however some shots do look washed out. Night shots look decent but not the best and can look overprocessed and grainy due to the AI scene recongition mode. I'll admit I've been spoiled by the P30's Leica AG camera though (one of the best smartphone cameras ever produced) so the experience might be different for you depending on what phone you're coming from.As for Audio, I do miss the baked in DolbyAtmos audio from the P30 which gave rich, detailed and crystal clear sound across the board with several scenario based modes to choose from, despite only having the one loudspeaker. The Nord 2 has arguably worse audio on balance but it does have the benefit of two loudspeakers which does claw back some of that loss.All in all, there is more than enough with the Nord 2 to warrant it as a truly worthy near-flagship upgrade from whichever device you're using now, like me with the P30 for example (I know, the standard P30 isn't a flagship)Nord 2 is a very capable device and has something for everyone with its impressive spec sheet and range of apps and features. I've had the 8GB RAM model for 7 months now and its still hitting the high notes like the day I got it. I can imagine the 12GB RAM variant is basically Nord 2 on roids. I fully recommend you to get this phone, you won't be sorry!Thanks for taking the time to read this. I might come back with edits from time to time.

OnePlus,OnePlus Nord 2 5G (UK) - 12GB RAM 256GB SIM Free Smartphone with Triple Camera and 65W Warp Charge - Grey Sierra [UK version],469,Fantastic phone for price but has drawbacks,"The Nord 2 is a fantastic phone for it's price. For a mid range phone it is priced very well. The Oxygen OS is slick, customizable and easy to use. The phone itself (8GB Ram) is plenty fast enough for most users. Fingerprint is fast, facial recognition is fast, charging is genuinely fast. Like silly fast. Like you almost feel bad how fast it charges.However, the phone does have some drawbacks. The main camera (50mp) is good, don't get me wrong. But, it does come with some flaws. The 50mp lens is just that. No optical (this is advertised) but it also cannot digital zoom. You cannot change any settings (AI etc) on the 50mp lens, just focus/Auto focus. It does take good pictures but it will not be the default when you open up the camera app. If you're in a rush trying to take a picture of something, you will have to manually change it to the 50mp lens every time you open the camera app (unless you keep it open constantly in the background). So you are stuck with the 8mp digital zoom lens which is okay but I want my 50mp lens to atleast have a digital zoom.Coming from a OnePlus 6 with notification LED, I really did not realize how good a feature that LED is. I miss it a ridiculous amount which is hilarious and saddening at the same time. Downloaded an app for the always on display to mimic but it just isn't the same and does drain battery.Overall, a really good phone. More phone than most people need these days. It isn't a ""flagship killer"" but it definitely is worth the money, especially when there is an offer on.And also as an FYI, the phone does come with its own clear OnePlus case (actually a decent case, see myself using it until it's properly worn out) in the box which isn't advertised. Would be nice to know this before ordering a seperate case to just end up returning after opening the box.

It counts down 3 seconds and pictures come distorted because people move thinking it took the photo already. You cant even search apps from the home screen. There is no gallery installed on the phone either. When you try to add photos to instgram after you add a third party gallery. They wont show up in the your camera feed to share.

OnePlus,OnePlus 11 5G (UK) 16GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 3rd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Eternal Green [UK version],799,"Perfect price, great phone but need to customise","The one plus 11 is a great upgrade to the one plus 7 pro. It has an amazing battery life, screen, responsiveness and charging speeds that still amaze me.Being able to charge my phone at an absurd rate to 100% and then also getting at least six hours of screen on use despite the most suboptimal scenario (5g, High refresh rate and display settings maxed) is a game changer and quickly dispels any concerns about the lack of wireless charging.I can't fault the phone for it's beefed up and tactile vibration feedback, sound quality and display quality. But now for the downsides.The software is snappy out of the box but then does feel a little clunky or unresponsiveness randomly. This, I believe, is down to how the phone starts to learn which apps you use frequently, which ones it needs to not keep in memory and general system optimisations.Remedying this is simple enough, do some research into settings to turn off like ram boost, animation timing and other things to keep it feeling snappy.Comign from an older oxygen os version I feel they have lost a lot of the efficiency. So much so that there isn't a huge amount of responsiveness difference between this and my old one plus 7 pro. I however, welcome the amazing battery life that the 8 gen 2 offers and yes it will handle pretty much everything without slow down.For longevity I went with the larger ram and storage version. Just because 12 gb of ram is ideal to keep pretty much any reasonable amount of apps in memory (no power user can really multitask that much on a phone).The other major major downside is how uneasy you feel holding this phone without a case. Soemthing about the ergonomics and glass back make this so slippery. Just resting in your hand it slips, I had to scavenge some grip tape for the few days I didn't have a case just because of this.So definitely get a case and that's then completely resolved.Cameras. Another one that one plus haven't made huge leaps in. They've instead delegated much of the quality to in built filters and ai processing. Which maybe fine but the raw ability of the camera has to stand alone to produce reliably good, share worthy images. Something that they actually had done really well on op7.The overall verdict. It's a buy at this price and represents unbeatable value without compromise. Overall I am very happy with it. It's short comings for me could be fixed is subsequent software updates. But as we all know we can't rely on one plus to deliver efficiencies but thank fully can rely on them to support android updates - however well or badly they are implemented.

OnePlus,OnePlus 11 5G (UK) 16GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 3rd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Eternal Green [UK version],799,Best phone on the market right now,"October 2023 update:After using this phone for 3 months, I have to admit that photo and video quality is so mediocre, specially in low light conditions. Battery also has not been as good as expected and I feel it is degraded over time.------------------------------------------I just had to share my thoughts on this amazing phone! First off, the battery life is just mind-blowing. I can go through my entire day without worrying about charging it constantly. It's a game-changer for sure!I've heard some people comparing it to Color OS, but honestly, it's Oxygen OS and is packed with awesome features. The split-screen functionality using the side bar is just so intuitive and easy to use, much like Samsung's One UI.It doesn't break the bank like the Galaxy S23 Ultra does! Why pay more when the OnePlus 11 offers almost everything you need at a fraction of the cost?Also with a promise of 4 years of updates, OnePlus has really won me over. It's even longer than what Google Pixel offers, and that's saying something (if you ever keep the phone for 4 years!)There's no wireless charging or IP68 rating, but that's not a big deal for me. The 100W charging (UK) is insanely fast, so I never worry about running out of juice. As for the IP68 rating, who really takes their phone fully submerged?!All in all, the OnePlus 11 has been an absolute delight to use. It ticks all the right boxes for me - long-lasting battery, impressive OS features, and a reliable camera. Plus, it saves me some serious money compared to other flagship phones. It's definitely a choice you won't regret.

OnePlus,OnePlus 11 5G (UK) 16GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 3rd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Eternal Green [UK version],799,Future proof,"OnePlus' advertising slogan for this phone should be ""never worry about battery life again."" The battery life on this phone is very, very good and the charging speed is even better. As such this thing is hardly ever on charge.That's mainly due to the processor. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is very fast but more importantly very efficient - moreso than Android flagship processors have been in a few years. Combine that with the UFS 4.0 storage (on the 256GB model), 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a commitment to update four versions of Android (up to Android 17) and five years of security updates, and this phone should be good for the next five years. If you want a phone to match the longevity of an iPhone, this is it.The build quality is up there with an iPhone or Samsung too. The fit and finish is immaculate and you can tell it is made out of high-quality materials. It feels solid and cold to the touch and has a fair bit of weight to it, although it's not too heavy like the latest iPhone 14 Pro Max. The circular camera sets the phone apart and as ever the Alert Slider is very useful (and should be included on all phones).I also find the software to be a pleasure to use. I have read so many comments and reviews bemoaning the move away from the old Oxygen OS to the new version based on Color OS, and there have been some teething issues in the transition, but now it's stable and mature. It's a great version of Android with more customisation options than before.Finally, I have been blown away by the camera. Having used Google Pixel's for smartphone photography for a while, I can happily say the Oneplus 11 is right up there with the Pixel 7. Oneplus uses Hasselblad colour science which is very much on the warm and saturated side of things. It's an acquired taste and differs wildly from the Pixel's cooler tones but I love the look of the photos. When zooming in on my monitor, side by side, I can see more detail in the Oneplus photos. This carries over to the wide angle lenses too, where the Oneplus packs in more detail and matches the colour science of the main lens.There are three main gripes I have with the Oneplus 11. There first is the telephoto lens only being 2x. It's useful for portraits, and it actually surprised me with how much detail is provides all the way up to 4x, but it's not in the same league as the periscope telephotos on the Pixel 7 Pro and S23 Ultra. At £800 I would have expected better. I would also have expected wireless charging and an IP68 water resistance rating, but neither of those are present. To be fair, I would never use wireless charging anyway given how rapid the 100 watt wired charging (which they include in the box by the way) is here but it would have been nice to have the option.In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Oneplus 11. I think it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the iPhone 14 Pro, the S23+ and the Pixel 7 Pro and I can't see anyone being disappointed in it.

When I first saw this phone and read the reviews online and on Youtube I thought ""Hmm, seems decent enough and the price is somewhat fair"". Now I would say its a bargin! The camera is fantastic and has several modes in which the camera takes fantastic HD and amazing quality pictures. The battery lasts near enough a day and a half on 100% charge. The phone is extremely fast and responsive to opening applications as well as closing them and modifying them. The screen is brilliant and the notch at the top is hardly noticeable when browsing and or watching viedos. The OS is a joy and is simple to use. The face recognition toke me by absolute surprise on how accurate and fast it works.Overall I would say for a burdget £300-450 range phone it is worth the money by far.My only criticism would be the lack of upgrading storage and or no audio port. But looking into the market of smartphones this seems to be a trend with most phone manufacturers. Bummer.If you are hesitant on getting this phone. I would say get it, you won't regret it!!! :)

OnePlus,OnePlus 11 5G (UK) 8GB RAM 128GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 3rd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Titan Black [UK version],,Exceptional value!,"I originally bought a Xiaomi 13T before the Black Friday sale, but then this suddenly had a massive price drop so I decided to give it a go. I've been through a month long saga trying to find the perfect phone for me (OnePlus, Xiaomi, Samsung) and this is the one!tbh I have no idea what some of the people are talking about in regards to the OS, everything feels super snappy. I debloated both the OnePlus 11 and Xiaomi 13T using UAD and the Xiaomi had far more bloatware on it, not to mention that oxygen OS is much nicer in everyday use than miui (and I always use a third party launcher so I could care less anyway tbh). The Xiaomi 13T supposedly has a similar processor but trust me it doesn't feel that way in practice. Something about that phone just felt ""off"".Battery life is excellent and if you optimise some settings you can get even more. I charged my phone to 60% whilst transferring some files and I've since had 6 hours screen on time (15% battery remaining). In comparison the Xiaomi would give me 8 hours from full charge with even more settings turned off. The charging is also super quick, like 0 > 100% in 25 mins. It doesn't even heat up as much as the Xiaomi did and that was only charging at 67W. Take into account that this is also day one of me using the phone so it hasn't even adjusted to my usage yet. So yeah if you are looking for good battery life in a mid tier phone then this is a solid choice, the only one that was better in that regard that I tested was the Nord 3 but I had more issues with that phone (including low wireless earbud volume, which I'm happy to say this one does not - Dolby Atmos sounds excellent).The phone should be getting android 14 in December or January and will get OS updates to android 17, with security updates to 2028 (by which point you probably want to buy a new phone anyway 😅).Display looks great even at the slightly lower resolution setting and I haven't noticed the auto brightness issues that reviewers & users on Reddit mentioned. Also although the screen is curved I wouldn't let it put you off as it's barely noticeable once you have a case on it.I won't mention too much about the camera quality because it's not what I use my phone for but it's perfectly acceptable IMO, and if you get the right case then the big camera Island doesn't protrude at all.TLDR; If you are a general person like me using socials, music, YouTube etc then I think you will be pleased.At this current price I don't think you are likely to find a better value phone.

Everything about the hardware (screen, speed, responsiveness, battery life, cameras etc.) is excellent. The 100W charging is insanely fast. Reviews mark it down for not having wireless charging but, when it goes from 10% to 90% in 20 mins, who needs that. It would get 5 stars but for two things.1. Although apparently in the hardware, there is no access to VoLTE (4G mobile calling) in the system settings/software. As the 3G network is being switched off in the UK this a major shortcoming and is unbelievable in a 2023 flagship phone. I did the obvious tests of swapping SIM cards and phone brands to confirm that SIMs which work with VoLTE in other phones don't work in the OnePlus.2. Customer service is as useful as a chocolate teapot! When contacted about the above (both email and phone) they have come up with nothing better than the equivalent of 'switch it off and on again', which does nothing. After weeks of requests to be put through to someone with proper knowledge of the OS I'm still waiting. I went through the same process with exactly this issue on my previous OnePlus 7T before finally getting through to someone in the technical team who eventually had to admit that it wasn't possible to access the VoLTE switch in the system software. His parting comment in defeat was that ""OnePlus are losing the plot"". I had hoped that they would have got their act together by now, but it seems they haven't. BTW, searching online forums it seems that VoLTE is enabled in the Indian market but not elsewhere, which makes the situation even more maddening.

OnePlus,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (UK) SIM-Free Smartphone with Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Pine Green 12GB RAM 256GB [UK version],506,Why all the OnePlus h8ters?,"I don't understand why so many OnePlus haters seem to want to dis this phone! My first OnePlus was a 7Pro which I had from launch day and really loved it, awesome phone. I waited 2.5 years to upgrade to a 9Pro and really pleased with it too. The screen on the 7Pro was awesome, but the 9Pro is even better with super dark blacks and really crisp. I held off on the Android 12 upgrade until the latest C44 upgrade and I've had zero issues with that too. The phones performance is awesome, nothing stutters or lags, great screen, great camera, 65W charging is crazy quick... I don't like charging to 100% to protect the battery life and it charges so quickly most time it's at 100% before I realise, having only left it for 20 mins or so! The irony also is battery life is less of a concern because it charges so quickly, but I get 2-3 days between charges so it's not an issue for me, but I don't game or watch video on the phone so my screen on time is pretty low in comparison to those use cases.The only area of concern for me was the camera bulge but I bought lens protectors for the glass and a protector which fits around the bulge (ie flattens out the gaps between the lenses) and I'm happier now about not scratching/ damaging the lens glass. Oh, and maybe the green colour isn't the best compared to the blue of the 7Pro, but nothing a different case can't fix!OK so I did pick the 265GB version up at a great price (under £700) so maybe those who paid over £900 feel aggrieved, and maybe I've been lucky waiting as hardware / software / OS updates have been largely ironed out.For the right price it's an awesome phone IMHO. I was looking at an S21 Ultra 255GB but at almost half the price the 9Pro is no way half the phone.... All it lacks is the S21s super zoom, everything else is the same as far as I can tell...  So, after just over 2 months of daily use I'm super pleased with my OnePlus 9Pro.

OnePlus,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (UK) SIM-Free Smartphone with Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Pine Green 12GB RAM 256GB [UK version],506,"Brilliant experience, only drawback is software at the moment. That should be fixed with Android 12!","All-round brilliant experience!The battery -  lasts a very good amount of time, for a phone with such a great screen, it lasts above 5 hours of continuous use with 120hz and 1080p. I found the battery going from 95-1% in 5 hours of screen time and 16 hours uptime.The cameras - are really good, a bit lacklustre in some departments but honestly can be easily fixed with software tuning. The Hasselblad Collab brings an interesting choice of colouring that makes for a sometimes odd-looking image but in good lighting this camera is Grade A! Not to mention the night mode and low light pictures are phenomenal. However again I think a software update would be needed for video performance in low light.The screen - is one of, if not, the BEST screen on any phone right now! It rivals the S21 Ultra! It's bright, clear and filled with great colouring. Watching IMAX Disney Plus films in 1440 mode and 120hz is a magnificent experience.Not to mention, the speakers are very very good and deliver good surround sound in landscape mode!As for the overall software experience - it's classic OnePlus and they do deliver on that simple but customisable experience. Come Android 12 and OxygenOS 12 (OnePlus' Software) we are going to need to see some fine-tuning. As for when that happens? This phone will most likely be a no brainer, a brilliant phone and I hope to return to say all polished. There really isn't much to improve it's just minor bugs and inconsistencies (such as a sometimes inconsistent Bluetooth experience, I've seen devices a year old+ perform difficulty but a brand new set of earbuds work fine! Connectivity is the only real issue).An all-around brilliant phone experience, ESPECIALLY for the price, and soon I'm sure to be an excellent experience!If you can grab this device cheaper than launch price when the 10 series release, then do by any means possible!8.5/10 phone when compared to the high-end flagships, with the potential to be 10/10!

Too expensive for what it offers. It started to crash only after a couple of months of use. The camera is ok but not great. For a phone which costs near 1000£ I expected a lot more.  Battery life is mediocre, even if you don't use the phone for gaming. Switch Bluetooth or location on and you wont make it half a day on a full charge. Sometimes it overheats without even using it. Then I am forced to turn it off and leave it off for a few minutes.Oneplus should introduce at least 500gb of internal storage for a phone which costs this much.

Showcasing a catalogue of awe-inspiring features, this phone doesn't just meet expectations—it surpasses them.The first thing that strikes you about the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is its blazing-fast performance. Multitasking and app usage are seamless experiences, reinforcing the device's superiority. Its multimedia capabilities don't disappoint either—with brilliant picture quality and immersive sound, it’s tailor-made for a top-tier media consumption experience.OnePlus's collaboration with the esteemed camera company, Hasselblad, has culminated in a unique Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. This partnership has accelerated innovation in mobile photography, featuring natural color calibration. The potent combination of a primary 48 MP camera, a 50 MP ultra-wide camera, a telephoto lens, and a monochrome camera guarantees breathtaking photos. This impressive camera suite shines even in challenging, low-light conditions.But the delights of the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G are not confined to photography. The smartphone features a 6.7-inch Smart 120Hz AMOLED display, enriched with LTPO technology, delivering a fluid and vivid viewing experience. Remarkably, the display achieves a 120Hz refresh rate while consuming up to 50% less power—an undeniable testament to its superior engineering.The innovative Warp Charge technology is another standout feature. Equipped with a 4500 mAh battery, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G exhibits astonishing charging speeds—jumping from 1% to 70% in a mere 30 minutes with Warp Charge 65T. Not to be outdone, the wireless charging capability is equally fast, promising a full day's worth of power in just 15 minutes.Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform, delivering a 25% boost in overall performance over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 865. It operates on OxygenOS 11, known for its clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.However, perfection is elusive, and the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G is not exempt from minor shortcomings. Users have reported occasional bugs and issues with the Oxygen OS, although these are likely to be addressed in forthcoming updates. The placement of the fingerprint sensor could also be optimized for greater accessibility.Pros:  • Extraordinary camera performance due to Hasselblad partnership.  • Fluid and vibrant display enabled by LTPO technology.  • Incredible charging speed, courtesy of Warp Charge 65T and wireless charging.  • High-octane performance powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G Mobile Platform.  • Aesthetically pleasing design and excellent build quality.Cons:  • Potential bugs and issues with Oxygen OS.  • The fingerprint sensor's placement could be improved for easier access.In conclusion, the OnePlus 9 Pro 5G represents the apex of smartphone technology, offering an extraordinary camera experience, unparalleled performance, and a breathtaking display. A few minor flaws aside, this phone is a compelling contender for anyone seeking a flagship device with state-of-the-art features. It delivers on its promises, making it a worthy addition to the top tier of the smartphone market.

OnePlus,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (UK) SIM-Free Smartphone with Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Stellar Black 8GB RAM 128GB [UK version],526,"Excellent phone, especially when picked up on discount.","Review from OnePlus 6 owner. True flagship experience. Getting all of the flagship features that have been missing in previous generations. Picked up on discount for £ 620. While the 9 Pro is a lot more expensive than OnePlus's previous devices (especially at RRP). It's great value when picked up on sale as it's close to being as good as a S21 Ultra while undercutting it by over £ 300 even when that phone was on its best discount too. OnePlus phones are on sale more often now since the brands popularity has grown and the phone is now available at multiple retailers in the UK. Back in OnePlus 6 days the phone was almost never on sale so even though the devices are more expensive now, you can still pick them up for around £ 450-650 when on heavy discount half a year later. (Especially for non Pro model). At these discounted prices I feel like they might even offer more value then the previous OnePlus phones did at the £ 500 RRP. I've listed some of the main pros and cons that I've experienced below.Pros:- Amazing bright & smooth screen- Great performance- Clean software- Elegant design, Stellar Black colour looks super stealth- Very good rear cameras especially ultra wide. No fish eye effect. Good detail and dynamic range. Video in artificial light surprisingly good also even at high resolution & high framerates due to large camera sensor.- 8k video good for future proofing. But I think 4k video is a lot more consistent and what should be used instead.- Loud and clear stereo speakers.- High quality vibration motor adds better haptic feedback. Both this and the stereo speakers are massive upgrades from older OnePlus devices.- Great that the phone still comes with a charging brick in the box. Very Fast wired and wireless charging. I timed a 5%-100 wired charge in 27minutes. This changes the way you use a phone. Such a great feature!Cons:- Fingerprint sensor placement isn't the best. Would prefer it to be a bit higher up on the screen.- Speed and reliability of indisplay fingerprint sensor Isn't as good as rear mounted OnePlus 6 one. Still very quick and good especially for indisplay sensor. Surprised how good these are. Minor con.- Front camera not as high end as competitors.- Battery life is an A- not A+. I get around 6-7 hours screen on time running phone at 1440p 120Hz. This depends on your usage habits so can vary for different users.

After 3 beta tests the stable release broke some essential features (like mobile signal...) And removed some existing ones (One plus have now withdrawn the update for further work). If you need a new phone get a pixel 6 or an S21 instead.Old review:Good things (coming from an s20 ultra)-Latest Snapdragon chip-The matte finish on the back is better than shiny glass.-Fingerprint reader is very fast and much more accurate than my last phone.-Oxygen OS is close enough to stock android to use as is (sooo much better than One UI).-Supplied wired charger is superfast!-Camera is pretty good so far. I prefer not having super saturated photos as I did with the s20 ultra.-Comes with a case-Battery life is good, the phone lasts me the day.-Cheaper than a Samsung-The whole throttling thing-Despite that it can get quite hot under heavy load.-One+ are apparently merging oxygen OS with Colour OS and future updates will be based on that.-Not much clarity on the number of OS updates for the device (Samsung are actually good at this now, how things change).-No SD card slot or headphone jack.I guess I'm happy enough. I think the days of new phones surprising with design or new features are long gone. This is a good device with a few drawbacks that will nonetheless do very well for most people at a slightly lower pricepoint than its competitors.

OnePlus,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (UK) SIM-Free Smartphone with Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Morning Mist 8GB RAM 128GB [UK version],442,This phone is an absolute beast for the price.,"Ok, so you're probably wondering why it's cheap considering the specs and I'll be honest I have absolutely no idea because this phone competes with the Samsung S21 Ultra, which is 2x the price.As usual I was hesitant to buy because of a few not so good reviews, but I'm convinced they are left by people who are unable to set up a phone correctly.First of all, the phone comes as FHD+ as default, you need to change the display settings to QWHD to get that beautiful sharp display. And let me say, the display is absolutely stunning, sharp, beautiful colour production, amazingly smooth 120hz refresh rate that is immediately noticeable, and the screen also has software accelerated motion smoothing which further adds to the silky smooth video production.I purchased the 128gb 8gb version and the phone is actually extremely fast, sometimes it takes me by surprise!! Runs some more visually demanding games buttery smooth.The phone itself feels premium quality in the hand and the back is a thing of beauty, especially in the colour morning mist. The camera lenses are large and look really pleasing to the eye.Battery life is 4/5 BUT, This is a big BUT.. You have no idea how fast this phone charges. 30 mins to 100% and it's not spec sheet lies. It really does charge faster than anything I've ever witnessed! Amazing for people who use their phone a lot and wish to charge for a little bit after heavy use, 10 mins will easily charge to 30%Moving to the camera itself, if you are unfamiliar with Hassleblad whom collaborated with OnePlus to create the camera system create very high end medium format cameras. As a photographer with 20 years experience I definitely have a valid opinion of it's performance, the cameras are really great in well lit situations, with great colour reproduction, sharp images with great clarity. Low light is harder to get a sharp image but that can be corrected with a little tripod.My only gripe would probably be the shutter time, I've had phone's that are faster but as a landscape photographer this isn't a problem.The selfie camera is good and produces a bookah effect, although it's software produced, this is still not good enough to retire your DSLR!The operating system is android obviously but the oxygen OS mod that oneplus produced is by far my favorite, it's easy to use, plenty of customisation options and definitely has a one up on samsung.Overall, I'm still in shock at the price for such a phone.. have they messed up the pricing?

OnePlus,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G (UK) SIM-Free Smartphone with Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Morning Mist 8GB RAM 128GB [UK version],442,Amazing phone but don't buy on Amazon,"The delivery was quick but the packaging was definitely tempered. As you can clearly see in the picture, the original seal is broken and a transparent tape is applied ....the box came exactly as shown in pic.As per the phone, it's a good mobile as per the price. If you love photography, stick to pixel 6....there is no competition to that. I chose one plus 9 pro over pixel just because of warp charging with in box charger and body design. One plus feels lighter than the new Pixel series.I have done lot much R&D among Samsung S21, Pixel 6 and One plus 9 pro. Let me know if you want any comparison details in specific.

OnePlus,OnePlus 7T Pro 8 GB RAM 256 GB SIM-Free Smartphone - Haze Blue (2 Year Manufacturer Warranty),,Fantastic phone,"The speed at which this phone charges is amazing.There is nothing more annoying than knowing that you have to leave the hose in 20 mins or so for an all day event/work, knowing that your phone is at 5% or so due to forgetting to charge it. In just 10-20 mins of charging, the phones battery will go from 5% (in my example) to 50% plus easily. For peace-of-mind alone, it's one of the features I love the most.The 90Hz refresh rate on the screen is also fantastic, and really doesn't dent the battery life all that much. I'm not a heavy user, but do spend a lot of time on Twitter and Reddit when commuting to and from work.I came from a Pixel 2 XL, which was having an issue with it's battery charging port, which was driving me nuts, especially as I am very forgetful when it comes to remembering to charge the thing. I had to hold the charger in the port and keep pressure on it just to charge.Camera wise, it's not as good as the Pixel, but to honest, you'd have to look pretty close to see a huge difference. The front camera pops up for selfies (if that's your thing) as well as for facial recognition. I tested dropping the phone on to my sofa with the camera out, and it will instantly go back in if it senses that the phone is falling, which is a great little feature.Price wise, it really is value for money, as you will be paying a lot more for the features that this device has when compared to other flagship devices. The OLED screen also look incredible compared to my previous Pixel XL 2.

OnePlus,OnePlus 7T Pro 8 GB RAM 256 GB SIM-Free Smartphone - Haze Blue (2 Year Manufacturer Warranty),,This tempted my away from 10 years of iPhone. Best decision EVER,"I have had iphones on contracts for 10 years. I also have a Mac as my only computer, so was reluctant to try anything else.However, I decided that I needed to break away from the contract loop, and buy a phone outright to use with a sim only deal.  This phone blew away the competition at the same pricepoint.I LOVED my iPhones.  My last one was the iphone 8, which was coming up to 2 years old.  This phone absolutely destroys it in every way.The screen!  OMG - no cut outs, no notches, just fills the entire face of the phone with 90htz, OLED goodness.  Seriously this is the greatest screen ever fitted to a mobile phone.The speed!  It charges SO fast! If I'm going out and my phone is on 15%, I can plug it in while I get ready.  20 minutes later it's at 80+%!  Every task you do on the phone is SO FAST! it makes my iphone look like a toy.The battery - I use it in a morning before work, as a sat nav for an hour, on and off during my 8 hour day at work, and as a sat nav on the way home again.  It's never dropped below 55% by the time I get home.  My iphone would have needed a good charge half way through the dayOxygen - The optimisations that Oneplus have put into this phone are incredible.  It's Stock Android, only better!Compared to the Apple experience.  OK - it doesn't natively play nicely with a Mac.  But I can now do everything that I did with my iPhone, plus a whole lot more.  A bit of research gave me a great mail app, a great messaging app (that I can also use from my Mac), screen mirroring and phone control from my Mac etc etc.  In short it's not as 'plug and play' as using an iphone within apple's ecosystem - but everything is possible.Seriously if you are considering this phone, just buy it - it is completely and utterly fantastic.  The best phone I have ever seen or used, by some margin.

OnePlus,OnePlus 7T Pro 8 GB RAM 256 GB SIM-Free Smartphone - Haze Blue (2 Year Manufacturer Warranty),,"Amazing phone, moderately good battery","Had to give it a couple a days before reviewing. It's been about a month now and I'll have to say, OnePlus may have a new fan.Started off on the Samsung band wagon, when the Note 2 was the biggest phone you could get, I loved the screen size. Tried almost every phone you can think of, I even had an iPhone 6s Plus until this OnePlus came along. Currently wrapping up the iPhone to sell.Pros- Stupid fast!- Silky smooth- Futuristic look- Nice customizable UI- Well pricedCons- Battery with 90hz and 2k hits the battery a bit. I still get home with about 70% and then play games, scroll social media, watch YouTube for about 4 hours then the battery goes down to about 30%Now that's pretty good, but I had a Huawei Mate 20 Pro and that phone had ridiculously good battery life.The good thing is you can turn off 90hz and 2k and you'll have superb battery life but thats not fun- lack of premium phone cases... Like really, where the good looking wood and leather cases at?- I've slightly missed wireless charging, not enough to stop using the phone, but occasionally I find myself wanting to just put the phone on a charging pad.

OnePlus,"OnePlus 8T 5G 8GB RAM 128GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with Quad Camera, 65W Warp Charge and Dual SIM - Lunar Silver - 2 Year Warranty",370,"Great phone, Great price","For £400 (or less with warehouse) it is phenomenal value... only the poco f3/X3 can really compare in terms of value. As I mentioned earlier, if you can find it significantly cheaper with amazon warehouse, it's great. I saved a bunch, and when I slapped a case on it, you can't see any of the physical imperfections caused from that. When it came missing its case and sim ejector tool, I was really pleased with the refund I got to cover the costs of them separately. You get everything that much more expensive phones have; 120hz AMOLED display, great build quality, (somewhat) decent cameras and video, various unlocking techniques (although my face id works when I have a tighter mask on sometimes - so uh, yeah), super fast (last gen) flagship processor, and excellent charging capabilities included in the box *cough* Apple and Samsung *cough*.The charging speed and battery capacity is really great (don't care about wireless charging), it does get a little warm to the touch after charging at 65W for a little bit, so if you are charging it overnight, I recommend using a slower charger if you have one just to keep the battery cool when charging to help lengthen battery life. So if anything, the charging is TOO fast, but it's is amazing if I need to charge it for like 5 minutes if I'm low. The OS is clean and snappy, fingerprint and face-id are fast, and the sd 865, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of UFS 3.1 storage powering it all is really really fast. The speakers are actually quite good, and 5G support is always appreciated, never connected to it, but still cool. I also just want to mention the alerts slider, my favourite non-standard part of the phone imo, If I'm going somewhere where a notification sound is not ideal, I can switch it to vibrate or silent while it's still in my pocket.The cons; the screen is great with that 120hz smoothness, the contrast and colours are amazing, and the front camera is nicely out of the way in the corner. I'd like to say I noticed a massive difference between 60 and 120hz, but I didn't, there's a difference in things like scrolling, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker if you want to save money on a cheaper phone; I did notice that my old phone felt slower than I remember though, so maybe don't go the other way if you've experienced 120Hz before. However, when in settings (on dark mode obviously) you definitely notice some smearing when the pixels have to transition from off (black) to on. This is not exclusive to this phone though, a friend of mine has a pixel where it also happens, it is an OLED problem as far as I know. And unfortunately I don't think the screen gets bright or dim enough, I like it really bright when I'm outdoors in a bright environment, and I like it dim in a darker environment, like when my lights are off; unfortunately it doesn't do either of those well enough, although the not-getting-dim-enough problem is the one I find more annoying of the two. Having said that however, when watching films, the colours and deep blacks due to OLED technology are AMAZING. The cameras are the only actual disappointment really, they are oversaturated, and dark colours just look black, it's really annoying. The detail is... fine, I expected better tbh. But please OnePlus, fix the colour processing with an update please! Luckily for me, I don't care too much about cameras, so not too much of an issue for me. But if you really do, may I point you in the direction of the Google pixel lineup.I honestly can't complain too much though. The cameras are still good for a £400 phone, it comes with a pre-applied (plastic) screen protector, and everything else is really premium including the build quality. It doesn't have an ip rating, but it does have some water protection around the sim tray, so I would guess, and what some reviewers have said, that they forego the rating to save costs, but still include the protection anyway.

OnePlus,"OnePlus 8T 5G 8GB RAM 128GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with Quad Camera, 65W Warp Charge and Dual SIM - Lunar Silver - 2 Year Warranty",370,Excellent Phone,"This is the one I wanted. Had a 1+7Pro for 18 months which was great but just a bit big and heavy.  This is 10% lighter and perhaps 5% shorter but that makes all the difference.  Feels perfect.  Fast, excellent software and OOS 11 is not as bad as people make out in terms of being non-stock. I can't really say I've noticed much difference from OOS 10 and this was one of my worries.  As usual, it comes with a screen protector already on it (may not be thick but it's there) and a clear TPU type case, which I usually end up buying anyway.  Always-on-display is just what I wanted, the new 65W warp charge is crazy and with a 2-3 day battery (I got that on the 1+7Pro anyway) you only charge it when you realise it's low, not over night or any of that panic.  It's loud, has stereo speakers (top one if a little tiny but fine), and just works.  I must admit the 8 is probably great too but it's the same price so why not get this.  As me anything, so far loving this phone.  Oh yes, not QHD+ like the pro was but it's so good I can't tell the difference really.Update after going to a 9pro. The 8T is probably one of the last good OnePlus phones which does everything well. I've seen this on here for £363 which frankly is a bargain. It isn't the smallest, prettiest device around, sure, but if you want a great phone which all works, with a very good screen, crazy fast charging for good value, this is it.

Having upgraded from an older Huawei P10 plus, I was looking for a Phone with good hardware, good battery life and non flagship prices.The phone is fast, has 8 gig of memory for running lots of apps at the same time and has a lovely 120hz screen - the whole experience is snappy and smooth.The camera is good enough, it's not Huawei good by any stretch but it's good enough if you don't want or need the best camera on a smart phone.Android 11 and Oxygen OS seem like a nice combination for a UI and feature rich OS, and a decent upgrade if you came from Android 9.The under screen finger print scanner is nice and fast but as it's optical, clean dry hands and screen are a must. If you want more flexibility in this regard, a phone with a sonic scanner might be a better choice.The battery is a whopping 4500 mah and benefits from a 65 Watt fast charge which 1plus call 'warp charge', it takes just 29 minutes from zero to full battery. It's very impressive and takes any chore out of charging your device, a few other well known companies would benefit their consumers by following on the example of 1 plus in this regard.Only time will tell if the lack of ip68 water and dust protection will go on to reduce the longevity of the phone but so far, so good.Recommended.

Seeing this feature in operation with my own eyes on my home network was one of those lightbulb moments that a) 5G is no joke or affectation; data transfer speeds are *everything* in mobile technology and b) whatever the share price says, Apple are dead in the water; their closed loop technology model makes so many things that should be effortless unnecessarily difficult if not impossible.  Having struggled with iTunes for the last 10 years and having used this phone for three weeks I would say confidently Apple are done, living on borrowed time and will eventually go the same way as Nokia.Data transfer, processing capacity and memory size are all fantastic but there are some issues.  First, battery life is poor.  OnePhone's warp charging is *really* fast but you are quickly aware that this phone has minimal battery capacity; if you are more than a moderate user and cannot recharge at least on a daily basis or dislike using an external portable charging source think very carefully about this phone.  Turning the gloomy default brightness (someone let marketing out if their padded cell to fiddle with the standard specs I think) up to something that is actually visible and shows the screens capabilities only makes the problem worse.  I am lucky in working from a desk, if I was on the road I would always have a couple of back up external batteries to hand; you are certainly going to need them.  Second the instructions with the phone are superficial, remote support is limited and the device has some usability howlers. The worst example of this, the phone's file system shows in File Explorer in an anonymous subfolder called AC2003 with a completely separate, unrelated and practically useless but boldly labelled OnePlus Directory complete with OnePlus logo that lists only the drivers.  Why didn't they put everything in a Folder called  ""OnePlus Nord?""...  I am not surprised to read several new users struggling initially to connect the phone to their PC...  Add to this their online support is very poor, I am typically kept hanging around for hours while some knownothing asks irrelevant questions pitched way above my head in an attempt buy time to read an online manual and in an attempt not to look stupid.  I would rate the online support 2/10 - it really is that bad.  So battery life and some issues about usability show I spent £400 rather than £1000 but overall I am hopeful it has enough processing, memory and data transfer horsepower  to future proof me and give the 8 years I got out of the iPhone.

OnePlus,OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (UK) 12GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 2nd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Emerald Forest [UK version],899,A decent successor,"Having used pretty much every generation of OnePlus in past and being accustomed to the UI and quality standards I would say this one doesn't disappoint. Don't listen to the biased reviewers, decided to go for this one after giving Pixel 6 a try for a few months and it was like a breath of fresh air. 80w charging is something you can't overlook, especially since you get the actual charging brick in the box,plus a free case and a preinstalled screen protector. OnePlus have stuck to their super thin and light design, great built quality and the exterior is amazing (granted the camera module design is an acquired taste) no complaints there, at least from me. The phone looks super premium, fingerprint works flawlessly, God I missed that, especially whilst having been stuck with the pixel... Camera quality is up there, hardly the best but definitely not mediocre. 10bit shots can come up with some insane results, more than enough for the average every day user. The display is just out of this world, resolution is great, refresh rate I'd say matches the performance of my recently departed 8T. Battery life would vary, on a heavy duty day, I'd be at about 20% around 8pm-ish so can easily stretch to a full day depending on usage, mind you the super fast charging more than makes up for that. If you come from an earlier OnePlus, then the new incarnation of the oxygen os would be a bit of a disappointment but still dominating most of the alternatives on the market. Generally speaking if you're looking for that established OnePlus experience you can't go wrong, despite the relatively higher price point, I believe it's still more than worth it if you're considering OnePlus.

OnePlus,OnePlus 10 Pro 5G (UK) 12GB RAM 256GB Storage SIM-Free Smartphone with 2nd Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile - Emerald Forest [UK version],899,Superb.,"After having my Samsung s10+ for many years the lure of a new phone was on my mind. After some careful research I stumbled across the OnePlus 10 pro. Looking into many of the specifications that the new flagship devices had to offer I was surprised that my older Samsung still had many cutting edge features like screen resolution and storage capacity. So I was initially drawn to the s22 ultra, but seeing this in the flesh just reminded me of a note device, and those corners will ruin a decent pair of jeans. The s22 had inferior specs to my nearly 4 year old s10 + so that was a downgrade and wasn't prepared to pay for that. Now onto the OnePlus 10 pro, this has a superior chipset, screen, ram and looks so smart. The software is lightning fast and is super slick. This is the first time I have dieviated away from Samsung in decades but the oxygen software is a breeze. The charging with 80watts is nothing like I've ever experienced before, and even the wireless 50watts is faster than many wired devices today. The technology that OnePlus are delivering to their customers is fantastic. The camera is co developed by hassleblad and is amazing, it actually makes a wide lense usable instead of a gimic. Delivery was next day, set up was a breeze. I would highly recommend, and you get a pair of wireless, headphones... but only if you order quick!

Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy A15 Blue 6.5"" 128GB 4G Unlocked & SIM Free Smartphone",101,Just WOW! (Caps intended and earned!),"I don't normally leave reviews on anything I purchase on here but with this phone I felt compelled to.Firstly, I have to say it took me a LONG time to find and land on this phone after hours of scrolling through hundreds. You see my price range was between £100-150 and I wanted the one I chose to have it all and finally I found this. Now, here me out obviously nothings perfect in this world sadly and you may have read the reviews about the charger not coming with it so you have to pay more for one (unfortunately that's how it goes with newer phones these days. Luckily I already had a Type C charger from my old phone that's worked fine so if you do have one laying around use it! Or if you're not sure it's the right one look which type charger it is from the phone it was from online you'll find it on Google by typing the model of the phone and specs) BUT believe me when I say THIS phone is without doubt the best phone I've ever had and I'm truly stoked that I went with it! I've had just about every brand of phone there is and countless, various models from each and I tell you now that this one for this price range is the best you'll get. It's appearance is stunning and the pictures don't do it justice. It's just the right size in all measurements. It's slick and the display when viewing photos and videos are clear and vivid. I was very impressed with the built in speakers also with a smooth sound when listening to stuff even on a low volume and speaking off smooth the actions on the phone when using it are just that. I've experienced no problems thus far and that's after a week off heavy use. The battery is great but I advice you to keep it at 85% to prevent it from being damaged which you can do in the settings. Once at 85% it should last throughout the day  depending on how you use it. I'm extremely fussy when it comes to devices so I know what it's like when you want them to have certain requirements so if like me you want it to be able to run certain apps/games look into the specs available from the phone using Google again it'll tell you what you wanna know. I've found no fault in this phone so far and it's been thoroughly tested by me already. Its a great budget phone and it's even under £100 without the case/screen protectors (I do advise you to get them as well though because they really look after it and for £15 more it's better than paying out for repairs or a new phone) I'm so glad I took the leap of faith with this! Best choice I've made this year for sure!

Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy A15 Blue 6.5"" 128GB 4G Unlocked & SIM Free Smartphone",101,Make sure you message seller first,"Most of the A15's are being sold by third party sellers.  While the phone is one of the best I've used, be aware that the stock of these third party reduced models are random stock for use in whatever country they are produced for.  I'm returning my first A15 back to a third party seller I bought it from a few weeks ago due to an issue with some freezing, so I ordered a second one just the other day, that had a completely different seller, and it came to me white not blue, and with  Arabic on the back of the box.  I haven't bothered setting it up coz obviously this one's going back too, since I don't want issues cropping up later.  The seller DID mention  to me that their stock is random.  So I was preparing myself anyway.So might be worth a try if you contact them first or just after purchasing to request a UK version.  Either amazon or the seller directly.The experience from using the first A15 I had from the first seller, was above my expectations.  I don't know if it's because I hated my awful A14 that gave me constant problems, but this is a very very good phone.  It almost seems odd at this low price to have such a smooth and fast phone.I will be buying the A15 at full price instead of third party sellers (once i return the two I have) since I know this model is definitely worth the full price.Hope this review is a handy heads-up to those looking at buying one from here.

The micro sd slot is an added bonus (although you have to choose between this and a second sim), as I like to keep loads of music and photos on my phone.

Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A14 4G 64GB black,102,Good cheap replacement,"Bought this for my 14 year old daughter as her phone ""broke"" somehow........  I was at the gym dad, listening to music then I looked down and the screen was broken!  I don't know how it happened!The phone was an old Samsung J6+ so it was due a change , it was getting a bit glitchy and as the price of a new screen was at least 50 quid I thought why not get a new one.I was not going to be spending hundreds of pounds on an S22/23/24 or iPhone etc so I gave her a few options that all had similar specs and she picked this one.  So far she is very impressed with it.  it will not be able to keep up with the top of the range models, running on brand new processors etc, but for her, and the average user, it is spot on.Battery lasts all day most days, camera seems pretty decent for a mid level phone, functionality is pretty good and as quick as expected.  Nothing bad to report with the phone itself at the moment.FYI--- It does not come with a charger just a USB-C to USB-C cable so please keep that in mind as you will not be able to use a standard charger it will have to be a USB-C connection.  These are only about 5-10 quid so nothing major.Overall I would definitely recommend one of these if you are looking to spend about 120-150 on a mid level Samsung phone.  I have a S22 and this A14 can keep up with it on most aspects and even beats it on the battery life.  I was tempted to swap my S22 with her A14 as the s22 is starting to annoy me.  The only reason why I didn't is the size on the A14, it is pretty big at 6.5"".  Doesn't fit in my pocket very comfortably if I am being honest.  if that is not an issue for you and you love huge phones at quite a low cost I would recommend one on these.  if you want similar ""real world"" specs but want to spend another 200 quid get an S22, but I would not recommend one of those........My partner also has a J6+ that she is keeping alive, but I think I might replace that with an A14 when it does finally die off........

Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A14 4G 64GB black,102,One of the Best Budget Phone to Date.,"If your looking for the best budget phone that does what you need, you have come to the right place! This phone is very cheap considering the prices of other phones, It has a 60hz display that doesn't look awful, contains most features any other more expensive samsung phone would have, has a decent battery life (can last a day or 2 depending on how power intensive the apps you use are) and a decent camera with stabilisation for this price range (the camera is decent enough that I use it to record my youtube videos and they come out fairly good). The only drawbacks with this phone which may be bad depending on what you need the phone to do is that there is no NFC (contactless) on the phone meaning you can't pay contactless or use wireless charging and the fact that the phone DOES NOT come with a charging adapter but rather only a charging cable with USB-C at either end meaning you may need to buy a USB-C adapter separately or use a different cable with USB at one end and USB-C at the other end connected to a USB adapter just to plug it in to the wall. Other than that the phone has worked wonders for me! I Would certainly rate it one of the best budget phones out there currently! It is so good that I wrote this review using this phone.

Samsung,Samsung Galaxy A53 5G Mobile Phone SIM Free Android Smartphone 128 GB Black,243,The Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31,"I recently switched to the A53 from my Samsung Galaxy M31, primarily due to the need for 5G connectivity, since the M31 only supported 4G or lower. Let me start by saying that both phones are exceptional considering their price points. However, the A53 has proven to be a significant upgrade from my trusty M31.One standout feature of the A53 that has left me thoroughly impressed is its front-facing fingerprint reader. Unlike the M31, which had its fingerprint sensor on the back, the A53's placement on the front feels more intuitive and convenient. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference in day-to-day usage.Another area where the A53 shines is its screen clarity. Whether I'm streaming Netflix or watching YouTube videos, the display quality is top-notch. The visuals are crisp and vibrant, providing an immersive viewing experience that's hard to match in this price range.In terms of performance, the A53 has proven to be noticeably faster and more responsive than my M31. Apps load swiftly, multitasking is a breeze, and overall, it just feels snappier in everyday use. This improved performance has added to my overall satisfaction with the phone.To complete my experience, I paired the A53 with a Spigen Rugged Armor Phone Case. This combination not only provides excellent protection but also enhances the overall look and feel of the phone. It's become the perfect setup for me, ensuring my device stays safe while still looking stylish.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy A53 has proven to be a worthy upgrade from my Galaxy M31. With its front-facing fingerprint reader, impressive screen clarity, and enhanced performance, it has exceeded my expectations. If you're in the market for a budget-friendly smartphone with excellent features, the A53 is definitely worth considering.

It is probably worth the £499 price tag, but at £280 it becomes a no brainer. Its such a good all-rounder that I'm struggling to fault it. The camera is excellent, the screen is brilliant and the battery life superb. The only 'so called' fly in the ointment is processing power. But let me be clear... I have had no problem with its processor speed, not one. It's only in comparison to far more expensive phones that the processor falls short. Perhaps if you multi task on your phone and have multiple apps open at once, you may notice some lag. But I and your average phone user doesn't need that much processing power. So the A54 is perfectly adequate for every day use. Also if you are a big phone gamer,  then this is perhaps not the phone for you. Sound is on a par with more expensive phones and is stereo. Build quality feels very, very good with glass front and back. Video is also very, very good. Yes, there are better phones out there for sure. But none in this price bracket (under £300) can compete with the A54. I believe this phone at this price is a true bargin and that's not something you see very often these days.

I wanted a bright screen viewable in bright sunlight, the Samsung has it, I wanted long battery life, the Samsung seems to have it at 2+ days on my usage - I could get 3 days out of the Moto. Quick charge - tick, and the blurb says "".. 60% after half an hour of charging time  It takes 65 minutes to fully charge the device"", which is my experience. . Speed - its lightning compared to my previous phone. Regular upgrades - seems so. Good camera - v. good camera. Expandable storage - should I need it (probs not).What I don't do is gaming, extensive filming and editing and other intense compute tasks.What I don't need is wireless charging, my Moto 30w charger is fine  The in-screen fingerprint and face recognition work fast and well.What I can't abide is the Samsung One UI overlay which gets everywhere. Having used various Moto Gs for quite a few years, I'm used to the clean, unadulterated Google experience, but I think I've weeded most of the Samsung cludge out now, what a pain!Oh, and I don't think the cell performance is as good as my Moto using the same SIM, I seem to be getting 1 bar less especially at home where it's almost zero.In summary, a great phone, great performance, gorgeous screen - and at £230-ish, an absolute bargain, but Samsung software means I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars.

Samsung,Samsung Galaxy S21 5G 128GB Grey Unlocked (Renewed),200,Awful,"The phone itself looked okay, I didn't really use it much for the first 4 months. I bearly used it for more than 2 hours a day. Once summer came about I started to use the phone more frequently. This is when the issues came about, the phone would overheat if used for more than an hour of normal use. If I used an app or tried conduction a video call the phone would generate so much heat that I couldn't hold it. The phone would even tell me it needs to close apps to cool down. The battery life was also terrible, it wouldn't even last 4 hours if I used an app. I don't mean playing high resolution games, Im talking shopping apps, checking my banking or writing emails. I tried to work through it but it got too much so I had to return it. It took me 8 months from the time of purchase to return it, as I could not get a suitable replacement phone (not from amazon) until then.When I tried to return it, the company that refurbished it, URcouk, said I had to pay for it to be returned, then once they received it they offered me either a 50% refund or they can send the phone back which they had apparently fixed... Again. When I objected to this, they explained nothing nor pointed me to any terms and conditions, they simply ignored my message and repeated the offer.To summerise, I would recommend avoiding any refurbished equipment that is connected to URcouk. Their workmanship is clearly of poor quality and their customer care is non existent and insulting.

Reasonably snappy performance and good display. Cameras also good. Fingerprint unlocking is a little slow compared to my old Moto G 5G Plus., and the phone also annoyingly requires you to unlock using PIN/Swipe from time to time anyway (holding your finger on the sensor has no effect under these circumstances).If you're wondering why the price is so competitive, it's probably because this is a UAE model (i.e. not originally intended for the UK market). So far the only difference that I've noticed is that there is no eSIM functionality. If this is important to you, then I'd recommend you pay more for a UK model.

For all three of these purposes, I'm pleased with the performance of the phone.I'm sure there are phones that take sharper, more beautiful photos under low light conditions. But I'm just taking snaps to share with friends and family - and I'm happy with the quality of these photos.Listening to music, I use a third party app that I previously purchased on the Google Play store. The app is working fine and the music quality played through my Bluetooth headphones is excellent. I think the sound quality is more dictated by my headphone quality than the limitations of the phone.Watching YouTube and Netflix, I'm happy with the picture quality. I can't detect any pixellation or stuttering of the frames.The phone is also perfectly fine for the few calls I make. It's fine for phone calls as well as video calls.I'm not a picky phone person. I wanted an inexpensive phone that was able to take a memory card (so that I can physically back up the photos that I take). The phone is on the heavier side - but as I usually just have the phone shoved into a pocket, I really don't notice the extra 10 or 20g in weight. Overall, I'm very pleased with the phone and think it's excellent value for money.

Samsung,"Samsung Galaxy S23 5G SM-S911B/DS 256GB 8GB RAM, 50 MP Camera, Factory Unlocked, Global Version – Phantom Black",559,Great phone if somewhat expensive at normal price.,"Got this in a Black Friday sale as there was a substantial discount, to upgrade from an almost 4 year old S10e.It's a very nice phone - premium look and feel, decent screen size but still 'compact' as modern handsets go .. you can 'one hand' it.  Screen clarity of the OLED is very good.Performance is excellent - super snappy for everything and handles intensive tasks with ease.  The battery life is also good, if you are not using it heavily you can expect 50% or more by the end of the day and even with reasonable use it generally doesn't go below about 60% for me.  A massive improvement over the previous S21 model by all accounts.  I don't use fast charge (to preserve longevity of the battery) so I can't comment on that.  Qi wireless charging is my preferred method and very convenient.Camera is very good - I was certainly impressed as a complete novice.  Likely to be more than good enough for the average person.The Samsung One UI actually isn't all that bad and arguably adds to functionality.Drawbacks - No MicroSD card support so go for the 256gig version.  No headphone jack .. bluetooth is fine but I have lots of great older wired phones that need an adaptor now.  It still seems to be maintaining a high price despite the fact its about to be replaced - I would not have bought at the full £850 or so that was the regular price at the time.All in all, one of the best Android phones you can get if you don't want a massive near-tablet sized slab.

Samsung,Samsung GALAXY A34 5G (256GB) BLACK,239,Great phone,"We love these phones. This is the second one we have in our household now, this time the 256gb version, although such a huge storage probably isn’t necessary. The phone battery life is just awesome, this is lasting for sound 48 hours and still not fully discharged. The phone itself feels sturdy, the screen is amazing. We are definitely Samsung and android fans, and setting it up from an old phone was a doddle. There are plenty of options for phone cases, it looks really nice and performs to perfection. They are water resistant but haven’t tested that fully. The only disappointment (which we knew when buying it) is that it doesn’t support wireless charging but that is a nice to have. It has two SIM card slots if you need it, otherwise the second can be used for a micro Ss card for storing photos etc. although with such a huge memory you don’t really need it. Recommend this phone five stars no question.

Samsung,Samsung GALAXY A34 5G (256GB) BLACK,239,Incredible value for money,"Being a bit of a tech enthusiast I like to thoroughly research through multiple sources before I decide to buy any gadgets, computer parts etc. This phone has been widely praised by many and I've got to say after receiving it they were 100% correct.After a couple of weeks I can safely say this phone is probably the best value you'll find.It's chipset by Mediatek is extremely good, despite appearing to be less powerful than the Exynos chipset  (A54) in the benchmarks. In real world scenarios, it matches and even regularly outperforms the latter. The battery life is great, easily a days worth of capacity with moderate to heavy usage. 120hz display is nice and smooth, stereo speakers sound great considering how small they are and plenty of promised software + security updates as standard with Samsung.The only things I was worried about with this phone was the outdated ""tear drop"" style border around the selfie camera, which really isn't as intrusive as it may seem and it missing a 3.5mm headphone jack. Which really isn't that bad either as the 5.3 Bluetooth works flawlessly with pairing and not dropping connection. You can buy reasonably good earpods on amazon for as little as £15.If you're on the fence about this phone, I highly recommend you just get it. It's by far the most well rounded in the price bracket, some other phones offering slightly better features in a certain area but at the heavy cost of another.Very satisfied.

Chinese phones at this price point offer more bells and whistles but after 2 years you have to start looking at installing custom ROMs.I have always been skeptical of Samsung budget phones as they offered very little for the premium price they charged.  But after reading good reviews of the a34 and the promise of 4 OS and 5 years of security updates, I took the jump. And wow!Pros-The screen. The screen is to die for on a £230 phone.IP67 dust and water-resistant. Unheard of at this price point.4 OS and 5 years of security updates.Great battery life.Cons.No charger in the box.25W charging in 2024 is abysmal.The A34 is a well made phone with a middle of the road chipset, a fantastic screen,  great battery life, and long lasting support from the manufacturer.Bargain.

I got the peacock blue p30 lite for £180. The phone has great battery life. I can play games and it will genuinely last for a long time (ofc will vary from people and typea of games and apps they use). The fingerprint scanner is instant! Like no lag when using it. The face rec is decent too, I prefer the fingerprint but I use both and they both good. The phone looks sexy as hell too. But its a fingerprint magnet, so buy a clear case in addition since UK models dont get cases. And oo charges really fast too.It does have a tiny amount of lag when there are lots of apps open but its only 4gb and ONLY for £180 its a no brainer. Obviously, there more expensive phones will be better no doubt, but this will do everythinf you want. And it has google play services too.Will update this review if anything changes.edit: this is after a year of using the phone. DO NOT USE WITHOUT A DECENT CASE AS I UNFORTUNATELY LEARNT MY LESSON. I don't really drop phones, but I ended up dropping this a few times from my pocket because of my wired headphones. (btw..go for Bluetooth...less stress) anyway, Yee, it cracked on front and back, I have alot of spiderweb type cracks from the light impacts on the floor and basically the lesson is to just buy a case, the phone is very delicate. But even after the massive cracks, the phone still works which is okay I guess.also, after using for a while, yeah, you notice the lag once you download a bunch of applications, so while it is I think 128gb, I'd say don't buy expecting to throw a bunch of junk onto it and expecting it to be as fast as the latest Samsung. Have reasonable expectations and it will be a decent device for you. It's a smartphone ;-; does everything you probably need from it unless ya a hardcore mobile gamer.

Not this phone is not affected by the Google services restriction only the P40 onward doesn't have play store so you're totally safe with the p30 lite 2019.And it Has a standard headphone socket!!!Great battery, fast charging (no wireless charge)This is a great buy, one of the rare reviews I'm giving a 10 out of 10, the price to performance is unbeatable.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P30 Lite 128 GB 6.15 inch FHD Dewdrop Display Smartphone with 48MP AI Ultra-wide Triple Camera, 4GB RAM, Android 9.0 Sim-Free Mobile Phone, Single Sim, UK Version, Black",114,A brilliant mobile!,"My Huawei P20 Lite got dropped and the screen rather mangled. So, I decided to upgrade - and wow, what a difference!I am so pleased with this purchase. It has plenty of memory, a good display and the rear 'triple' camera is absolutely fantastic.The P30 Lite is surely comparable with other mobiles costing much more. At £182, this must be considered a bit of a bargain.Its a ""factory"" SIM Free UK device so there are no nasty and annoying telecom logos or additional 'bloatware'. The power adapter has the correct UK 3-plug and the screen comes ready fitted with a screen protector (albeit not tempered glass). I wish all manufacturers would do that!The mobile auto updated to EMUI (Android) 10 on first power up. I then used Huawei Phone Clone to move data from the old to this new mobile.It did a reasonable job though about 20% of the APPs didn't copy (probably due to the change in Android version). So, it took about an hour to manually download and install the missing APPs. The good news was that device set up (eg. WiFi settings, contacts, screen layout) did copy across.I use a slim case and a wireless charging card. Wireless charging works fine and is reasonably quick.I also added a 128gb micro SD card - so I have plenty of space.I don't play many games on a mobile but everything I have tried works smoothly and well. Video playback is excellent.I have a Huawei Matebook D 14 2020 laptop so I am able to use 'Huawei Share' to connect to and control this mobile. Its great when working at home.If I wanted to be harsh, I could say that battery life could be a tad better. That said, it easily lasts a day and has improved after a couple of full charges - I just bung the mobile on my wireless charger when I go to bed.Overall, I am very chuffed and rather pleased....

I wanted to upgrade from my P20 Pro and honestly couldn't find a better phone (for me).New, they are still around £600+ and the second hand ones are around £350-500 go I was attracted by the price from this seller.Reading the reviews I was worried but noticed that the bad reviews were from older reviews, up to date reviews were good. So I ordered and then saw that I might have to pay import charges!The phone arrived a day late, I think because it was being prepared prior to final shipment.It didn't come in an original box, just the phone, charger and cable.The phone was immaculate, no marks, damage or anything. Described ""as new"" and it was!The charger isn't branded Huawei but is a 40w Adaptive Charger with a UK plug. It works fine, faster than my p20 Pro.My only irritation is that a standard charging cable was included and so couldn't achieve fast Charger rates. I swapped it with a higher capacity cable and it was fine.So, no Italian branding, no foreign charger, dual sim. No import charges.Ignore the critical reviews from the past, in November '21, the phone is excellent.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P30 Pro - Smartphone 128GB, 8GB RAM, Dual Sim, Aurora Blue",285,"Great handset, few minor issues.","Camera and battery life are excellent, the last handset from Huawei with Google & Android support which is essential for those who need the phone apps for banking etc. Phone is delicate though, glass back and front so get a decent case with it. Bevelled screen edges means it is sensitive to impact from a greater range of angles than say an Iphone 13 that has a metal back & sides and flat inset screen. Also not waterproof so be careful about that.This is the 3rd time I've bought this model, over the last 6 years. It's been quite painful to replace as being so good it holds its value well compared to competitors. The only real weak point is the sim tray and internal sim transport - be very careful with this as it is easy to damage and can get loose over time, leading to eventually being unable to recognise the sim card.I'm not fussed about 5G so much, unfortunately if you want a 5G Huawei you won't have the Android & Google support and apps. Thank the geopolitic nonsense between US & China for that. It's never gonna convince me to buy an Apple guys, give it up.

It's a great phone that I used to get 2days out of the battery. Sadly it struggles to get a day now. But considering how long I have had it and used it on a daily basis, I'm very happy with that. Which is why I purchased another one. However, the advertisement says single sim uk version (model number CLT L09), which is not what I received. I received a dual sim International version (model number CLT L29). There are slight nuances between the 2, the screen at the bottom curves in the corners on the international which it does not on the UK version. The OS is slightly different and it will only upgrade to Emui 10, rather than the Emui 12 I currently use. This may not bother others, but it did me.  The phone did come new in box and sealed. However, the charger plug did have tiny dents in it around the top and the top plug insert was very wobbly. I wouldn't expect this for a brand new sealed phone. If I had received the phone I thought I was getting this would be a 5 star review as the p20 pro was and still is a great phone but I've knocked a star off due to the afore mentioned reasons.

First the good.Great hardware. Exceptional camera as you've probably seen in the reviews and the UI is easy to use. The screen itself is crisp and sharp - and at a nice high resolution. Phone is very responsive, and I find the memory capacity more than enough for my app needs. Battery often lasts a couple of days, and a supercharge can be done from near empty in under an hour. I like also how easy it is to link your phone to a screen, either via USB C at work or say a FireStick at home. The phone compass is a bit iffy, but generally good enough for navigation and bearings. The finger sensor is slightly fussy I've found in terms of matching the angle you registered a fingerprint at. Facial recognition works well, but as a security feature I would turn it off - it doesn't have the depth perception capability of the Apple phones.Now the downside. And it's a big one for me personally. Huawei's EMUI operating system is set to aggressively preserve battery life. This means that any non-core app gets put in to sleep mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity, and this includes WhatsApp. For me, and many others I bet, WhatsApp is their principal comms platform. If you don't log in to WA for about 30 minutes it stops polling for messages. Many a time I've checked in after a few hours and received a ton of messages in one go. I've changed all the possible settings (and there are a LOT that are hidden away) but none of these fix it. I've spoken to Huawei support and they advised wiping my phone, then suggested I contact WhatsApp for a fix!!  Look around, there are many other posts on this subject. If WA messenger is important to you, then I would not recommend this phone with EMUI 9, at least until they fix this key issue.

Almost every day I'm finding more fantastic and practical things incorporated into the phone. I just had the latest LG model which wasn't anywhere near as good as this and was 3x the price. This in my opinion is one of the best phones on the market, and I'm including iPhone here. I've told so many people that if they are replacing their phones to get this model. I'm 41yrs old and as you can imagine I've had all sorts of different types, makes and model of phone but  I really mean this, this is the best so far. After using this phone for 2 or 3 months now and getting used to it I'm simply amazed at how cheap it is. Every function works perfectly. Also after using it for a bit now I'd gladly have paid a lot more knowing the quality. I opted for the package deal which included the case and tempered glass screen. I would recommend this as the case is great with a stand that sits your phone in the perfect position to watch you tube or movies etc, the stand part is also a large ring that you can put a finger through whilst on a call making it almost impossible to drop. I could go on and on. If you are looking for a phone in this price range then I can't recommend this phone any higher. It's simply fantastic.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P Smart 2019 64 GB 6.21-Inch 2K FullView Dewdrop SIM-Free Smartphone with Dual AI Camera, Android 9.0, Single SIM, UK Version - Black",,Not a great phone. Much better out there at this price point.,"Some things are fine, although having the buttons at the bottom in reverse to the Samsung and Xiaomi layout seems silly. There appear to only be a handful of basic settings in the drop down from the top. I bought it for my 8 year old son to play Pokémon go on the move so that's not a great concern. My main issue is that Pokémon go needs location to work, and it did work for 2 weeks. After two weeks it just stopped giving the game permission to access location and the phone tells me to check family link settings. Nothing has changed via family link but I reset everything anyway and double checked it had permissions, which it did, but still nothing. Google shows many other people having the same issue with location permissions on the phone/manufacturer. Maybe it's linked to the Huawei privacy concerns from Google, who knows, all I know is it's still not working 4 weeks later so is of limited use to him. I bought a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 at the same price point of £150 several weeks before this and I would say that is a much better phone in terms of functionality and user interface. Much closer to the mainstream brands. I chose Huawei this time because I understood it to be the competitor to the big brands which made me think they'd be more likely to have the finer points ironed out but it seems to be quite the opposite. I just had to buy a third phone for my partner and went back to Huawei without a second thought. I've gone Redmi Note 9 Pro this time at £220 because the improvements to battery and hardware are worth the extra I think. They aren't flagship Samsung's but they're not the best part of £1k either and I don't think I use my phone for anything where I would be able to tell the difference. To summarise; this experience has put me off this brand but I may have just been unlucky with the model.

HUAWEI,"HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro 128 GB 6.39-Inch 2K FullView Android 9.0 SIM-Free Smartphone with New Leica Triple AI Camera, Single SIM, UK Version - Twilight",235,The Mate 20 Pro brings a whole new meaning to flagship,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased reviewThe Huawei Mate 20 Pro is hands-down the best smartphone I have ever held, never mind own. It is extremely capable in every aspect and it never fails to perform the most demanding or takes. It will suit everyone, from the everyday consumer to the power user. There is so much to like about it and I would love to share all of my experiences of the device with you with my review of this device.Pros:High-res display2-3 day battery0% to 70% in 30 minutesSnappy Kirin 980 processor2 intuitive unlock methods3 professional camerasWireless chargingIP68 water resistanceCons:High price pointLarge notchBattery: The battery for this device is definitely one of the main selling points of the Mate 20 Pro. The outstanding 4,200mAh battery has been fitted in this device which is pretty amazing when you consider how thin it is and what the competition is putting in their devices. The large cell certainly pays off with heavy usage. The average user will be able to squeeze 2, if not 3 days of moderate use from this device. This is a big leap from other competitors and is just one of the many advantages the Mate 20 Pro has.Charging: I felt the need to include this as a separate topic as the charging speed on this device is in a league of its own. The stellar 40W fast charger provided with the device gets the device up to a comfortable percentage super quickly. Bearing in mind that the device has a large 4200mAh battery, it manages to charge from 0% to 70% in under 30 minutes. This is pretty spectacular and the fastest speed you will find on any flagship device. Personally I found this to be my favourite feature on this device.Camera: Just like the P20 Pro, the camera is also one of the main features of this device. It takes what the P20 Pro did and builds upon it by swapping the useless monochrome lens and provides a 12MP super wide angle lens instead. This is extremely useful and a change that I am personally glad that Huawei made. I find myself using this lens almost as much as the main one as it fits so much into the frame. Otherwise, the 40MP main shooter is super crisp and provides so much detail. It is one of the best smartphone cameras on the market along with the likes of Google and Samsung. This is another feature which defines a phone as high-end instead of mid-range.3D face unlock and in-screen fingerprint scanner: While the in-screen fingerprint sensor is not exactly a step up from traditional scanners in terms of speed, it certainly is when it comes to style. It makes it possible for the Mate 20 Pro to avoid any rear scanner while leaving as much room for the screen as possible. While it isn't 100% accurate, I found myself using it more than I expected to. When it doesn't work, that's when the 3D IR face scanner shows its accuracy and power. It is super quick and generally doesn't allow you a chance to view the lock screen as it turns on so quick.Speed: The Kirin 980 chip is by far the fastest processor in any phone currently. While it may be superseded by the upcoming Snapdragon 855, it is unlikely to bring much improved speeds over this chip. It is blazingly fast and I am yet to experience any stutter at all. It is powerful enough for all games I have tested and I have yet to find an app where it doesn't perform better than any of its competitors. The processor also does a great job of preserving battery by forcing intensive apps to close. The clever machine-learning algorithms are great at only closing what is not used and I found it keeping my most used apps consistently open while closing unnecessary ones.Software: While EMUI is known to be quite a heavy experience over stock Android, I have found the largest version which runs Pie from the box, to be super refined. Compared to EMUI 8 on my previous P20, the experience is a whole lot smoother and a pleasure to use. They have made many small tweaks which overall translates to a much more refined experience. Like always, I love Huawei’s stunning pictures used as themes throughout the interface and I really welcome the ease of navigation through apps and settings. While not perfect, I find the whole experience more and more like IOS by the update (not a bad thing at all!)Price: This is an important topic to discuss as the price will obviously be an important factor for most. At £899, it isn’t exactly cheap however it is exactly in line with there the high-end phone market is at at the moment. £899 is very reasonably priced and it is easy to see how the production cost is so high when looking at the amount of tech they crammed into this device. However, if that price is too much to swallow, I highly recommend taking a look at the Mate 20 Pro’s brother, the Mate 20. This can be found for £600 and boasts many similar features as the Mate 20 Pro so it is worth taking a look at. That also goes for the Mate 20X which has a whopping 7.2 Inch display which may be a bit much to handle for some but attractive for others!Other features: The most notable added feature is the ability to wirelessly charge other devices supporting the QI standard. This feature is a pretty nifty party trick and works pretty well. There are also a couple of other cool features such as the wireless desktop projection via miracast. This is pretty cool and really handy for projecting stuff from your phone direct to your T.V. Another cool thing you can do with your T.V is control it with the IR blaster fixed to the front of the phone. The last notable mention is the inclusion of IP68 water resistance. This means that your phone will easily survive a dunk in the pooling I think it’s a feature Huawei made a great decision to add.Overall, there is so much to like about this phone and very little to be wanted. The whole experience is so enjoyable and every aspect of the interface is so snappy and refined that it is hard to find flaws. While there are small things which could be improved on, most of them are software related which I have no doubt that Huawei is working to improve all the time. These are small trade offs to be able to own arguably the best phone on the market. Hands down the best phone of 2018 for me and only time will tell how this position will progress as we move through 2019 although it continues to steadily maintain it's ground.

HUAWEI,"HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro 128 GB 6.39-Inch 2K FullView Android 9.0 SIM-Free Smartphone with New Leica Triple AI Camera, Single SIM, UK Version - Twilight",235,Best of the best Flagship,"I received this product as part of a review program in return for an unbiased reviewGeneral CommentsWe are in an age when the difference between a mid range phone and a flagship is very small, so it can be hard to justify the additional money. This phone is proof it is worth it.Having upgraded from a Huawei P20 (a phone that I still thoroughly recommend for the price point), this feels like a phone worth twice the price!Build QualityFirst class - feels like a shiny pebble in your hand. Very large screen but easy to manage. Best in class build.Photo3 camera rear setup is amazing - Like a DSLR i your pocket.Top ranked on DXO mark and you can see why when you use it. Perfect shots every time.Night mode is amazing - this phone can see more than my eyes can!!Wide angle - surprisingly useful - can capture so much more than a conventional phone cameraMacro mode - a whole lot of fun!AI is really good at scene selection, but can easily be turned off if you do not enjoy.Front facing camera is good enough, although I suspect, not class leading.Battery LifeBest in class - 2 days easy and 7 hours screen on timeScreen6.39"" OLED screen is up there with the best screens available. Bright in sunlight, and deep blacks.  Surprisingly compact form as well considering screen size.Other FeaturesIn screen fingerprint - impressive stuff, but I generally use face unlock which is super fast and accurate (even when dark)Android 9 Pie out of the box with EMUI overlay. Love it, although it does occasionally look like it is trying to copy other brands.Wireless charging - using Huawei 15W fast wireless charger is convenient and quick (although accessory is expensive)Waterproof IP68 design so holiday photos in the pool are relatively risk freeKirin 980 processor and 6GB RAM give reliable snappy performance - never had any issues, gaming or general use.IR Blaster - useful when your remote control is lost down the sofa somewhere!!Software etc - many customizations - no longer need a third party launcherEven the ease of data transfer to computer from phone via wifi transfer (built into OS) is first class and well integrated.Negatives:No case or screen protector included in UK market - this was a big plus with the previous Huawei modelsCurved edge screen makes it hard to find / apply a screen protectorConnectivity issues with Fitbit - Fitbit does not officially support this deviceOverall - wholeheartedly recommended - provided you can afford the flagship price tag.

It was nice enough as it goes, but as I am planning a 4 week trip abroad I wanted something with a better camera.After ploughing through reviews and comments I decided to leave the Apply system and buy this Android phone.There are a few niggles (the prompting from Huawei to let them into your email) for one example, but for the most part the tailored Android system seems to work fine with all my apps.The phone itself is excellent.  The signal pickup  (EE) is very strong in this area.  It is a known bad area for mobile signals, so credit to this phone for getting 3 bars when my other phone (on O2) gets nothing at all!The audio quality is first class, both received and sent.The screen is easy to use, but the rounded glass body takes a bit of getting used to if you’ve used a ‘flat’ phone previously.All my apps run well, and quickly, and I can even do some photo editing in LightRoom on it, suck is the power of the processor.The quality of the screen is stunning.  Everything is sharp and bright.The camera is something else - in a good way.The quality of images from the camera are outstanding.It even has a RAW facility (something only found previously on high end DSLR cameras) and this enables you to access the original (large) and unprocessed camera file and apply your own sharpening, correct exposure errors, etc.I suspect very few users of this phone will actually use this but, as a photographer by profession, I am using it all the time.I have never paid this kind of money for a phone before, but I can see why it costs what it does.A fantastic piece of equipment.

Amazon were really good with providing me with a solution for not recieving a dual sim handset, and i can imagine an employee somewhere has got a slap on the wrist for the error.however the phone itself is phenomenal, and the update to the phone has erradicated all the bugs and glitches someone mentions. i did find that the update did not get pushed over the air, and i did need to download the huawei sync software onto my pc and update my phone that way. i did this within a few days of recieving the phone. since updating the phone has been faultless and i do not miss my samsung galaxy at all.It is a super fast smartphone, with smooth interface. the menus and themes are all customisable and theres something for everyones taste, although i imagine the fact that it cant be rooted will be an issue to some. i however have no interest in doing so.  the camera features are out of this world compared to other flagships, and the AI built into this phone really boosts what it is capable of.i like the notch compared with the s10+, and find i dont notice it at all sometimes ans its very small and central. the screen is good too, and really adapts well to save battery life. speaking if which, the battery is my most favourite part of this phone, as it easily lasts me 2 full days. i like the size of the phone as i can grip it well, although the screen is tall. the breathing crystal version of the handset is a talking point with anyone who sees it, but i do dislike that the camera sticksout quite a bit.all unboxing videos before release showed a preinstalled screen protector and clear back case included, so i was pretty dissapointed that the Uk releases didnt have them included. but i did have my trusted spigen hybrid crystal case ready before I even recieved the phone. ive bought a 3.5 to usb c adapter to use my existing earphones, although it would've been nice to have them included in the box, although a usb c earphone was included.  people need to stop complaining about the headphone jack not included, as going forward all future flagship phones will no longer carry them.i highly recommended buying the huawei p30 pro and cannot think of any reason why someone who wants to buy a flagship should hold back when compared with other competion. the only negative i must mention is that if you want to expand the 128gb memory you need to buy a different format of memory card called nm card by huawei, and it is very expensively priced compared to micro sd cards. most people may be more than satisfied with the already large internal storage though. also ive been having trouble finding a decent glass screen protector for the curved screen thats case friendly too. i must've gone through 8 different ones already and still searching. although i can imagine that being the issue with all curved screen phones.

This phone is almost identical to the mate 20 pro, except the camera is positioned differently. I got the phone up and running quickly by use the clone app, and moving what I wanted to move over. I paid £330 for the Pro 30 which IMO was a bargain considering I paid £1K for the mate 20 pro on prep order when it came out.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P30 Pro 128 GB 6.47 Inch OLED Display Smartphone with Leica Quad AI Camera, 8GB RAM, EMUI 9.1.0 Sim-Free Android Mobile Phone, Single SIM, Midnight Black, UK Version",343,Outstanding!!!,"I know all the rubbish about Huawei being blocked from using Google apps on future phones, but this phone still has full access to Google Apps and updates as designed and licenced before the issues with certain countries trade wars! Phone is extremely quick and easy to use, EMUI gets a lot of flack but I find easy to use and coming from IOS a lot of similaritys make it feel familiar and easy to use. For those who do not like it's IOS look you can enable the app drawers which a lot of people dont mention in thier hate of EMUI.The Battery gets me through 3-4 days of light use with no issues and putting on the ultr low power mode to enable phone/textand email only really extends the battry if needed.The camera is AMAZING, no complaints. the pictures a clear and detailed and the zoom is amazing, getting some good photos zoomed in. The 50x zoom allows you to identify far away details but does loose quality, but the 5x, 10x are stunning and even up to around 20x hybrid zoom is acceptable. Night photos are simply amazing, a dark night photo outside in a dimly lit street gives amazing detail, light and can identify colours of cars, grass, etc in street compared to iphone i had before where same photo gave little light, virtually no colour, detail and lots of noise at same light level.The transfer from phone software made the transfer of photos, contacts and settings from the iphone seamless.Games run really well and the screen is colourful and bright and resolution is more than good enough though lower than rivals. Can turn down resolution to a lower one to give extra battery life if needed although never really needed to do this. Sadly a lack of stereo speakers and Headphone socket let it down a little but the mono speaker is loud enough if not the best.

This is my first Huawei phone and i must say that i am pretty satisfied with my purchase. From last 6 months, I was looking to find replacement phone for my current phone. After doing research, i finalized on buying Mate 20 lite. Initial impression on receiving package of this phone was that design is stylist, light weighted and sleek. It came with a manual, sim opening tool, headphones and USB C charger, all in a premium looking black box. After switching on phone, the 6.3 inch screen looks impressive with its 2340 x 1080 resolution. It's bigger than last year's Huawei smartphone model with thinner bezels but has a larger notch at the top to allow for the double front camera. The colors of the screen look natural, if a little more muted than some other phones and the response to touch is really quick and accurate.Face recognition and fingerprint recognition can be used for securely unlocking the phone and both worked well. The Face recognition is the easier of the two as it just works when you hold the phone up and it works well in low light. On back , it has 2 cameras 20mp+2mp for blurring and distance effects with a f/1.8 lens. With Huawei AI technology, camera of the phone weighs more than it's weight and in my opinion at par with cameras of flagship smartphones. Camera app comes with a tons of options and added AI technology takes whole camera experience to next level by recognizing the subject very quickly. The front facing camera is 24MP + 2MP which is gives satisfactory performance as well. This phone runs on Android 9 version with Huawei OS over it which itself is quite optimized for performance. Though, being a first time user of Huawei UI it took me few days to get accustomed with features and shortcuts. Mate20 lite has a wide notch which can be put off for many buyers which is annoying to me as well but it is customizable. Huawei spend good enough time to enhance user experience in their smartphone with great features and one example of it is 3.5mm jack which is a bliss to have it in smartphones. Battery is superb for this phone. I haven't seen any phone with such amazing battery performance. One full charge easily lasts for 2 days. Overall, Mate 20 Lite is a great mid range phone which worth every penny you spend and gives you everything which you can ask from a high end phone in half the cost with amazing performance,battery,screen and superb camera.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P40 Pro - Smartphone 256GB, 8GB RAM, Dual Sim, Silver Frost",471,Great phone. However.....,"Great phone. Phone itself is great feel good in hand wokrs verry well. Speed really good storage good. Camera quality fabtastic have no words to describe. Having phone like this no need to have camera phone camera better than proper hand held camera. However with this phone felt like back 5-10 years back. All that spying scandal is shambles. Cant get all apps that you can get on samsung or iPhone. No blanking apps or not all unable use pay by phone directly need to have 3rd party account in order to able use huawei pay otherwise unable to likn existing bank cards or accounts. Unable to connect to the car. At this day and age surely you should be able. Really lacking google play app store. Unable even get proper maps. As much as huawei trying to get all apps that you need, they falling way back and need try bit more harder. So if you want fancy phone to take absolutely brilliant quality photos or videos and make calls and text this is greay for you. Obviously depends from the person using it you might find all that you need there.This is only my opinion.

This review is not about the phone but is about dealing with the refurbishers of it. When the phone arrived it was set in Chinese. In the end changed to English very easily. My knowledge of Chinese is nil and since all of the stuff on the phone was in Chinese I couldn't tell how to convert it. Since I had not expected to have to do this and had no experience of having to I looked at YouTube videos etc. None of which helped due to my poor eyesight and amateurs making the videos. I don't need to go on. I asked for a refund. Then started two days of stress trying to sort the refund with as always Amazon being helpful and communicating with the company to get me a refund. This was proving very difficult and probably going to end up with at some point Amazon having to give me a refund. In the end I resolved it myself and it was fairly easy but if you don't know, you don't know. You have to have knowledge of positioning of all Huawei  symbols etc if the language and writing is foreign to you. Or know someone who understands Chinese. All sorted now. I would despite the problems around Huawei phones unless you're an MP or similar recommend them as the best I have ever used. I would also heartily recommend the Amazon employees who tried to help me....Nil points to this particular refurbisher though, don't go near them. I have no idea how good the refurbishment is as yet but rest assured I will be back to this review  when I find out. What's happened so far is not exactly giving me confidence.

Still, not too bad, and considering a break and lose a phone every 6 months or so, it’s still better than buying brand new

I would recommend this phone to anyone. It has a brilliant battery life, a full charge can get you through 2 days, depending on what you use the phone for, if its gaming or streaming you'll need to keep you changer handy but if it's casual use, calls, texts, social media you can get alot out of the battery. The camera is sharp and clear, you can filter yourself in selfies, I choose not too lol easy to use and if your a lover of android you will love this phone, it does have Google play store installed and is compatible with all Google apps. It's easy to use and the finger print recognition is fast and always accurate. I've had Samsungs before that will continously tell you your fingerprint is not recognised, but this never happens on this phone. It still amazes me how fast it is and responds to every action. I can't tell you enough how much I love this phone. Any and all android users out there should have one. All the widgets are customisable and screens can be set up to how you like.

HUAWEI,Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Single-SIM) 128GB Android 8.0 UK version SIM-Free Smartphone -Titanium Grey,145,Great phone regardless of price,"Have had the Mate 10 Pro for a couple of months and really like it. I am a very experienced smartphone user (just adding that as a lot of reviews for phones on Amazon are often by very clueless people) and have had numerous Android phones, and I upgraded from a Samsung S7 Edge.It has a nice 6"" screen, but because of the small bezels it doesn't feel large in the hands or pocket at all. The cameras (colour and B&W) are really good, I am an experienced photographer with good cameras and lenses, and normally hate phone cameras, but this is the first phone I have owned where I will use it when out and about and not have to carry a camera with me all the time. The low light pictures are frankly amazing for a phone.Battery life is excellent, I can easily go a day on a charge, and it recharges to full in less than an hour using the supplied USB-C charger.It comes with minimal extra apps installed over standard Android. I can't speak much about the UI for the homescreen as I always use Nova Launcher, but the settings menus are well laid out and have a lot of useful features. Performance of the phone is very good, and the 6GB of RAM helps a lot.Phone comes with screen protector applied in the box, and also a transparent protection case.Downsides:This is the first USB-C device I have owned, and it has no headphone jack. It does have a USB-C to headphone jack dongle which does the job. It has a pair of earphones bundles in, but while the sound quality was pretty decent, they don't stay in my ears at all, they are very poorly shaped with no rubber cover to help them stay in. It has no MicroSD slot, but with 128GB of internal storage that isn't an issue for me.Overall it is a fantastic phone that performs like a flagship model but costs less than half the price. Is a real bargain IMO.

HUAWEI,Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Single-SIM) 128GB Android 8.0 UK version SIM-Free Smartphone -Titanium Grey,145,"My new, best gadget.","After buying a Huawei tablet (MediaPad M3 10 lit, 5*) and loving the build quality I decided to make my next phone Huawei. Decided on the Mate 10 Pro coz it had no notch and a 96hr battery rating on GSM Arena.What can I say? Awesome. Very good looks, solid build and it does have that great battery.The Emui skin is not too intrusive but I always put Nova Launcher on for my own customisation.It comes with a clear case, screen protector applied, fast charge brick and some USB-C earphones (and a 3.5mm to USB-C  for normal earphones you may want to use).The screen is great. The new 18:9 ratio that most phones seem to have means it's taller but narrower, easier on the pocket.It does have some strong power saving modes as default but you can soon sort out which ones to turn off. The battery life is really good. After a full, first charge, it took me 8hrs setting it up, with screen full brightness to run it down. Very impressive. After a few days with it being used normally, it easily gets through a day. Sometimes with 60% still left!The audio is another strong point. Using some hi res earphones I get some good, clear audio. I mostly use Spotify at very high quality. I did notice it doesn't like third party equalisers, preferring it's own, very customisable app. Using its own external speakers the phone uses a downward firing port for the lows while the earpiece handles the treble. However, switch to landscape mode, for video viewing and the two speakers then also split the audio to stereo too. Very good idea.The camera is very good, plenty of modes, though to be honest, I don't use it that often. A few stills, when out with friends etc but they look crystal clear.6gb of ram is more than enough to handle the four constant widgets I have on my home screen and still show no signs of lag.As this model has been superceded by the Mate 20 and P20 models, it's now over half the price it was a year ago. Also, although it's a year old, it still has Android 8 so still pretty much up to date, software wise.It's a great phone, that battery is phenomenal. Very happy with this purchase.

HUAWEI,Huawei Mate 10 Pro (Single-SIM) 128GB Android 8.0 UK version SIM-Free Smartphone -Titanium Grey,145,Late 2017 Flagship for half price! Result!,"Okay my LG G4 finally went bootloop after just over 3 years. So I needed a new phone. I'm never that much of a mug to pay more than £400 for a phone if I have to so took a look at what was going on Amazon for £250 to £400. So we had the Nokia 8 which looked great and super cheap but no notification light. Google Pixel XL MK1...great again but comes out of update support right now so no point. The LG G6 was looking solid if a little dull but I fancied a change maybe. Then the Mate 10 Pro was up. Great looking camera, half the launch price and plenty of storage. The other thing was the 4000mAh battery. If I can't change them at least I'll get a phone with a bigger battery. Oh and it has a notification light.Sold!Okay the phone took nearly a week to arrive but hey. First niggle is the charging cable is 18"" too short. The phone itself is great. I made sure I left the screen protector on by peeling the removal tab off instead. Into the case it went. Power on and two updates went straight on which was a good start. I then put back my apps and installed MS Launcher as I didn't want to get involved with EMUI. MS Launcher gives me the most barebones launcher once its tweaked as I want it.I was able to remove/disable 80% of the pre-installed stuff. The only stuff I couldn't was the usual own brand contacts/mail/messaging type stuff. Not terrible I suppose.So speed it great, as is the screen. You can change the screen colour but it comes pretty settled out of the box. The camera seems great though I haven't done much yet. B&W photography does look gorgeous I have to say. I don't take selfies being a 47 year old bloke.I don't listen to music on my phone so the loss of headphone jack is not an issue nor is wireless charging.One feature I miss from the G4 is the split audio levels for ringtone and notifications. Also I have to say the notification light on the 10 pro is a bit pathetic. It's the tiniest LED. Womp Womp!Battery life is tough to call as I'm still in the honeymoon period but it will do me fine I think.It's since dropped another £15 since I ordered it so even more or a bargain!Here's hoping it lasts me three years!Edit - As of Jan 8th, all going well, super well in fact. I got the Android Pie upgrade pushed to my phone about three days ago (about the 5th update I've had since October so not bad). Very nice indeed. Was amazed when the price jumped from the £360 I paid to £699 but seems to be coming back down now.

HUAWEI,"Huawei P40 Lite - Smartphone 128GB, 6GB RAM, Dual Sim, Black",175,Physically good phone: software is a mess without Google Play,"The phone itself is well designed and the physical devices - sound, camera, sensors, telephone/music etc., all work very well. But the Huawei App Store is extremely limited.Whilst there are lots of videos and other explanations on the web telling you how to get Google Play Store and the Google Account Manager working with this phone the reality is that success is very far from guaranteed, and installing them may make the Huawei Android EMUI OS unstable. Sideloading apps from other third-party sites may or may not work reliably, especially if those apps depend in any way on a working instance of Google Play or Google Account Manager.In short: Mea Culpa, buyer beware. It's a good phone if you don't depend on Google in any way. Otherwise, avoid it with prejudice.
